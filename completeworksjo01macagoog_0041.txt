LIF E OF GOWER xxix

We see here the picture of one who is not devoted to a par-
ticular party, but looks to what he conceives as the common
good, deeply impressed with the sense that things are out of
joint, and hoping against hope that a saviour of society may
arise, either in the person of the young king, or of his vigorous
and chivalrous cousin. There is no sign of any liking for John
of Gaunt or of any attachment to the Lanoestrian party generally3

but he is stirred to very genuine indignation at the unfair treat-
ment of men whom he regards as honest patriota, such as

Gloucester, the Arundels, and Cobham. He himself was
evidently a most patriotic Englishman, loving his country and
proud of its former greatness. For this we may refer especially
to Vox clamantis, vii. 1289 ff„ but the same feeling is visible
also in many other passages. He is a citizen of the world no
doubt, but an Englishman first, and he cares intensely for the
prosperity of his native land. Even when he writes in French it
is for England's sake,

When he decides that the Confessio Amantis could no longer go
forth with Richard as its patron, it is to England that he dedicates

he can no longer utter with sincerity on behalf of the worthless
king (Conf. Am. Prol. 24 and viii. 2987).

From the Confessio Amantis we leam the circumstances under
which that work was undertaken, owing in part at least to a sug-
gestion from the king himself, who, meeting Gower upon the river,
made him come into his own barge and conversed with him
familiarly on his literary projects‚ urging him apparently to the

composition of a poem in English, and perhaps suggesting Love ”
as the subject. We gather also that in the year 1390 the ·.

author considered himself already an old man, and that he
had then suffered for some time from ill-health (Ptol. 79¹⁸, viii.
3042*), and from the Epistle to Archbishop Arundel prefixed
later to the Vox clamantis, as well as from the Latin lines
beginning ‘ Henrici Regis' (or ‘ Henrici quarti ²) we learn that he 2
was blind during the last years of his lise, probably from the year
1400. We may reasonably suppose that he was born about
the year 1330, or possibly somewhat later. From the Latin
statement about his books we learn, what is tolerably obvious
