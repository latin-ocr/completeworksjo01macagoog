327 f. Cp. De Vita Monadorum, p. 182,

‘Sic mihi, divitibus si quando defuit hostis;
Hos terit et quassat saepe ruina gravis!

where, it would seem, we ought to read ‘ Dic mihi:

329 fl: De Vita Monadorum, p. 181. Most of the lines 329-348 are⁴
bongffckome ’ for ‘ N um,’ as osten: cp. v. 731.

3551. Cp. De Vita Monadorum, p. 182,

‘ Iustitiae montes virtutumque ardua nullus
scandet, dum mundi rebus onustus.erit.’

357. De Vita Monachornm, p. 190.

359-372. Most os these lines are borrowed with slight alterations
from De Vita Monachonm, p. 191.

387 ff. Cp. Mirour, 24733 ff.

389. Cp. De Vita Monacborum, p. 192, ‘Cur ampla aedifioes
busto claudendus in arcto Ρ ’

397. De Vita Monachorum, p. 193,

‘ Et cecidit Babylon, cecidit quoque maxima Troia
Olim mundipotens, aspice, Roma iacet:

419ff. Cp. Mirour, 24817-25176.

4211. For the idea contained in ‘ vnccio ⁹ and ‘ vncta’ cp. iii. 1376.

433. ⁸ The word comes receives its beginning not from vice but froin
vicium! That is, apparently, the prefix which makes ‘ comes ’ into
‘vicecomes ’ is to be derived from ‘ vicium.’

439 f. Cp. Mirarer, 25166 ff.

445 ff. With this compare the ·corresponding lines in the Carmen
super multiplici viciorum Pestilentia, under the head of ⁸ Avarice ⁹

(246 ffi),
‘Vendere iusticiam nichil est nisi vendere Cristum,’ διο.

4631. Cp. Mirour, 24973 ff.

467 f. Vt Crat: busa, &c.: cp. Mirour, 24962f.

498. Cp. Mirour, 22835 f.

522. The insertion which is found after this line 111 the Digby MS.
(and in no other) consists of eight lines taken from the original text
of the passage 54 5-580, which was rewritten by the author· . see
11. 561*-566* and 579* f.

523 ff. ‘ Can a house be built without timber? But of what use is
timber to the builder if it be not hewn ἓ* ‘Nonne’ for ‘Num‚’ as
frequently: see note on v. 731. It seems that ‘- sibi’ refers to the
builder rather than to the house ; in any case, it has no reflexive sense.
Finally ‘ligna’ is here used as asingular feminine: all the MSS. have
‘foret’ in 1. 524 and ‘valet ’ in 525.

The idea of the passage seems to be that good laws are as the
material, and the ruler as the builder of the house.
