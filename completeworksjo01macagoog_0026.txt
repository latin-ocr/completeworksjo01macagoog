xiv INTRODUCTION

hesitate before we identify John Gower the-poet with the John
Gower who acquired land from William SeptvanS. This latter
transaction in fact had another side, to which attention has not
hitherto been called, though Sir H. Nicolas must have been
to some extent aware of it, since he has given a reference to the
Rolls of Parliarnent‚ where the affair is recorded.

It must be noted then in connexion with the deeds of 39 Ed.
ΙΙΙ, by which John Gower acquired Aldyngton from William
Septvans, son of Sir William Septvans, that in the next year,
40 Ed. ΙΙΙ, there is record of a commission issued to Sir J.Cobham
and others to inquire into the circumstances of this · alienation, it
having been alleged that William Septvans was not yet of age,
and that he had obtained release of his father’s property from the
king's hands by fraudulent misrepresentation. The commission,
having sat at Canterbury on the Tuesday before St. George's day,
1366, reported that this was 80, that Williarn Septvans was in fact
under twenty years old, and would not attain the age os twenty
till the feast of St. Augustine the Doctor next to come (i. e.
Aug. 28); that the alienations to John Gower and others had
been improperly made by means of a fraudulent proof of age, and
that his property ought to be reseized into the king’s hands till he
was of age. Moreover the report stated that John Gower had
given 24 marks only for property worth Α 12 a year, with a wood
of the value of ,ζ 100, that after his enfeoffment the said John
Gower was in the company of William Septvans at Canterbury
and elsewhere, until Sept. 29, inducing him to part with land and
other property to various persons ¹.

The property remained in the king's hands till the year 1369,
when an order was issued to the eschaetor of the county of Essex
to put William Septvans in possession of his father's landS, which
had been confiscated to the Crown, ‘ since two years and more
'have elapsed from the festival of St. Augustine, when he was
twenty years old ’ (Westm. 21 Feb.) ². Presumably John Gower
then entered into possession of the property which he had
