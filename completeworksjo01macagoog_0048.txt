are Cut and Cur from their wretched kennels, the sheep-dog and the
mmlx-dog, the baker’s‚ the butcher’s, and the miller’s dog. The one-
1 eyed is there and the three-legged dog limps behind bai-king. These
<annot be soothed by stroking, but bare their teeth in anger against
you. They tear all whom they meet, and the more they devour the
less they are satisfied. Cerberus in hell hears their howl, and break·
ing 'away from his chains he joins himself to their company and becomes
their leader. More savage were these than the hounds which tore
Acteon or the beast which Diana sent to destroy the Atheniens. All
trembled before them. ’

CAP. VI. Another band took the form of foxes and cats. They ran
about and searched every cavern and every hiding—place, and made
their way into secret chambers. There was venom in their bite. The
caves of the wood send forth the foxes, who rob by day without sear,
and have a treaty of peace with the dogs. Τὶιο cats leave the barm

Owls join themselves to these and do by day the deeds os darkness,
sharpening their feathers with iron, in order that they may slay men.

CAP. VIII. Tine dream continued, andl saw another band in the
form of flies and os frogs. These were like those that plagued Egypt ε
the frogs oeme into houses and shed their poison everywhere ; the flies
pursued with their stings all those of gentle blood, and nothing could
keep them out. Their prince Belzebub was the leader of the host.
The heat of the summer produced them suddenly in swan-ms ε the fly
was more rapacious than the hawk and prouder than the peacock3 he
contended with the lark, the crane and the eagle.in ssight.

This was a day on which horses were overcome by asses, and lions
by oxea, a day in which the dog was stronger than the bear and the
cat than the leopard, a day in which the weak confounded the strong,
a day in which slaves were raised on high and nobles brought to the
ground, a day in which the terror of God’s wrath came upon all,
such a day as no chronicle records in time past. May such a day
never come again in our age!

CAP. IX. When all this multitude was gathered together like the

sand of the sea, one, a Jay skilled in speech, took the first place
among them and addressed them thus ε ‘ Ο wretched slaves, now comes
