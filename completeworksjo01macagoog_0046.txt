xxxiv GOWER'S LATIN WORKS

‘Et quia preuisa sic vota facit, puto culpa;'
‘Si bene conseruet ordinis ipse statum?

In any case it is certain that Gower expressed himself in Latin
with great facility and with tolerable correctness. He may have
imitated the style of Ovid ‘studiosius quam feliciu5‚' as Leland
observes, but the comparison with other Latin verse—writers of his
time sets his performance in a fairly favourable light.

VOX CLAMANTIS. ANALYSIS.

PROLOGUS LIBRI Pium.

From the records of the past we det-ive examples3 and though credit
be not commonly given to dreamS, yet the writers os past time instruct
us otherwise. Daniel and Joseph were taught by visions, and a man's
guardian angel osten warns him in his sleep. Hence, as it seems to me,
my dreams should be recorded as signs of the times; and what my
vision was and at what time it came, ye may learn from this book.

If ye desire to know the writer's name, add to John the beginning
of Godfrey, the first letter of Wales and the word ter without its head.
But give no praise to the author, for 1 write not with a view to fame.

as my matter is woful, so also shall be my song. My pen is wet with
team, and both my beart and my hand tremble3 nor am Ι sufficient to

rather than praise: my will is good, though my powers fan short. 1
pray that while 1 sing of those true visions which disturb my beart
with terror, he whose name 1 bear, to whom visions were revealed in
Patmos, may control my work.

was June: the moon had set and the morning-star had risen, when
from the West a strange light sprang, the dawn came from the region
of the setting sun and brought forth the day. The sun shone and all
the earth was bright3 Phebus went forth in his glorious car, attended
by the four Seasom, Summer being nearest to him then and honoured
by all creatureS. The meadows were bright with flowers and the flocks
sported in the fields, a perfect paradise of flowers and fruits was there,
with the songs of multitudinous birds. Such was the day on which
Ι wandered forth for my pleasure.

All things have an end, and at length that calm day had completed
its appointed hours; evening came and 1 lay down to rest. The night
came on, dark and gloomy as the day had been bright, and sleep did
not visit my eyes. My hair stood on end, my flesh and my beart
