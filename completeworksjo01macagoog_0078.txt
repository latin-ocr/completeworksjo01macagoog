initials and other decorations throughout. The whole is written in one
hand, and there are no corrections 01 erasures such as might indicate
that the book had been in the hands of the author.

The manuscript seems to have been in the possession os the Sotheby
family since 1702, when it was ‘ bought at Lord Burgley’s sale for
A 1 2s. od! No leaves are lost, but two are transposed at the end of
the fourth and beginning of the fifth books·

The text is very fairly correct, and the MS. is closely related to C both in text
and spelling (for which see i. Prol. 37 ᾗ, i. 21, 95, 447, 1706, 1776, 3017, ii.
174, 311 &c.), but not derived from it (see i. 41, 1626, 2094, iii. 1760 s., v.
785 fi). The passages which in C and the other original copies are rewritten
over erasure, as iii. 1 ff.‚ vi. 1161 fl„ are usually given by F. in the revised
form, but the marginal notes at iii. 375 and iv. 587 are omitted. occasionally
too, where C has a correction, Ε gives the original reading in company with
H, as iii. 840, v. 785 ί, and especially in the passages vi. 1⁹19 ff. and vii.
182 ff„ where H no longer agrees with SCG in corrections, we find that Ε
goes with H. In the final poems E shows some independence as regards
marginal notes, e. g. in the last piece, where instead of ‘ Nota contra mortuo-
rum executores‚' we find the much more pointed, though doubtfully gram-
matical, remark, ‘Nota quod bonum est vnicuique esse executor sui ipsius!

This is the only MS. except CHG which contains the short pieces at the end.
and the omission from these of ‘ Presul, ouile regis' may be an indication that
the MS. was written before 1402.

As regards the picture in this MS„ the features os the archer are quite
different from those represented in the Cotton MS. He has a prominent
pointed nose and 3 light-coloured moustaehe and beard; the armw. held
between the sore-finger and the second and aimed upwards, covers the
mouth. The dress consists of a grey sur cap with a hood under it of light
crimson, cover-ing also the upper part of the body ε below this a blue surcoat
with brown lining and wide sleeves 'thu-own back so as to leave the arms bare:

a red belt with buckle and pendant, and red hose. The globe is at a higher
level and 311131101- in proportion than in the other pictures. Like them
it is divided into three, the lest hand upper division having a crescent
moon and four stars: a red cross with a banner stands at the summit of
the globe.
