chapter-headings Lib. vii. cap. xix to the end, the lines ‘Ad mundum
mitto,’ probably with a picture of the author, and Vox clamantis Lib. i.
ProloguS, 11. 1-18. After s. 13 one leaf (Vox Clamantx's· i. 766—856).
After f. 131 one leaf (De Lucis Scrutinio 9 3-103, probably some other
short piece, and the French Traitil, to iii. 3).

This MS. was certainly written and corrected under the direction of
the author, and remained for some time in his handS, receiving addi-
tion from time to time. From the Epistola at the beginning, which
occurs here only and seems to relate to this volume in particular, we
may gather that it was eventually presented to Abp. Arundel. It is
possible that it passed from him to his successor Chichele, and so to
the College of All Souls, where it now is, but there seems to be no
definite evidence to confirm this suggestion.

The text of S in the Vox clamantis agrees in the main as regards revised
passages with that os the other original manuscripts C, H and G, but in some
respects' it is peculiar. In Lib. iii. cap. i. S has a rewritten version which
differs from that of the other revised copies, and the same is the case with
regat-d to the lina ‘ Quicquid homo scribat ' (p. 365). There are also some
places, as iv. 1072, 1197-1232, v. 450, where S retains the original text in
company with ΤΗ, or even with H, alone. A few possibly n‘ght readings are
peculiat- to S, as in i. 1788, 2073, ii. 300, iii. 380 (margin), 1642, v. 325, vi.
555, while some others are common to S with G alone, some few small
mistakes remain uncorrected, as in i. 106, 953, 1212, 1591, 1662, iii. 176,
989, 1214, 1541, 1695, iv. 273, 336 &c.‚ and in some cases, where the head·
ings of chapters have been rewritten, as vi. cap. xviii, xix, the original
headings are left standing in the Table of Chapters at the beginning.

At least five hands are distinguishable, as follows 1

(1) the original text of the Vox Clamanti-s.

(ο) the original text of the succeeding poems, French and Latin, and the
rewritten text or corrections on ff. 15 νο (i. 1019), 90 v⁰ (vi. 545), 97 (vi.
1159), 115 νο (vii. 1454 f„ 1469 fi), 116 (last lines of Vox Clamanu‘s).

(3) the original text and (probably) the corrections of the Epistola, f. i, and
the corrections or rewritten text on ff. 36 νο (iii. 2 fit), 39 (iii. cap. iv. head·
ing), 97 νο (vi. 1189), 98 (νί. 1219 ff.), 115 1ο (vii. 1409 ff.), 116 (first lines os
Cmn. Yn'p.), 126 νο, 127 νο, and the text of ‘ Quicquid homo scribat!

(4) marginal note on s. 40 νο, ‘ Nota de bello Cleri' 810. (iii. 375).

(5) marginal note 011 f. 66, ‘ Nota quod Genius’ &c. (iv. 587).

111 addition there are some marginal notes which are not quite contem-

porary, as those on ff. 51 νο, 52, 76 νο, 77 (⁴ Contra rectores Oxon.' &c., ‚

‘ Nota de muliere bona' δια), and the heading of the last piece on s. 137 seems
to have been rewritten over a hand different from any of the above, bs which
some words‘remain. Α few corrections are in doubtful hands, as vi. 1208.

Os the above hands the first, very regularly written in a fourteenth century
character, in brown ink, is probably the same as that of the Vox clamantis in
G, and the same scribe apparently wrote the lina which are supplied
sometimes in the margin os H, having been dropped out os the text by the
first copyist. The second (a) is also a very neat and regular hand, but os
a somewhat later type. lt appears in the French and Latin poems of MS.
