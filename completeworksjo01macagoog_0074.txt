ally in corrections of Gand H. The fourth (4) is that in which the same
marginal note is written also in C, H and G.

Ι 113νο 10 thank Dr. Young the Librarian of the Hunterian Museum‚
sor facilities given to me in using this MS. and for his kind help in
collating and describing it.

The text of G 1133, as might be expected, a close affinity with that of S,
but the peculiarities of S 33 regards revision in certain passages, e. g. iii. 1 fil,

- iv. 1197 ff„ are not shared by this MS„ which goes here with the other revised

copies, C and H. In one place at least G has a further touch of revision,
viz. in the heading os vi. cap. vii., where its reading is shared by D. ln a
good many instances, however, G stands with S (sometimes in company with
D or L) in support of a probably true reading which is not given by other
MSS„ as i. 465, 468, 979, 1454, iv. 72, v. 789, vii. 684, 1342, or os an error,
as i. 1535, 1870, 111. 1863, iv. 799. It may be noted that sometimes in G an
erasure has been made without the correction being supplied.

The following are some os the hands that may be distinguished in this
manuscript:
