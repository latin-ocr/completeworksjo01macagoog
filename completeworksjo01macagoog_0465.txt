NOTES. Lm. Ι. 541-943 · 375

810. Itis difficult to see how this line is to be translated, unloes we
suppose that ‘ fossa ⁹ is a grammatical oversight.

821. Cp. ovid, Metam. i. 211, ‘ Contigerat nostras infamia temporis
aureS.³

849 f. Adapted from Amores, iii. 9. 7 f„ but not very happily.

855 ff. With this passage we may compare the description in
Walsingham, vol. i. p. 454, ⁵ quorum quidam tantum baculos, quidam
rubigine obductos gladiOS, quidam bipennes solummodo, nonnulli
arcus prae vetustate factos a fumo rubicundiores ebore antique, cum
singulis sagittis, quorum plures contentae erant una pluma, ad regnum
conquaerendum convenere.'

868. The reading ‘ de leuitate ' is given also by G.

869. limpidiores. The epithetis evidently derived from 1 Sam. xvii.
40, where the vulgate has ‘ et elegit sibi quinque limpidissimos lapides
de torrente!

876. ‘ These fools boast that the earth has been wetted,' &c.

871 ff. Cp. Metam. xi. 29 f.

879 f. Cp. Conf. Amanus, Prol. 37²³. One of the charges against
Sir N icholas Brembre in 1388 was that he had designed to change the
name of London to ‘ N ew Troy.‘

891. siluas· que palustribus, ⁶ from the woods and marshes!

904. Cp. ovid, Ars Amat. iii. 577 f.

909. Cp. Metam. viii. 421.

919. Corpus Christi day, that is Thursday, June 13.

9291. via salua: apparently meaning ‘Savoye,’ the palace of the
duke of Lancaster in the strand. In the next line ‘longum castrum’
looks like ‘ Lancaster,’ but it is difficult to sayexactly what the meaning is.

931. Raptis-teque domus. This is the Priory of St. John of jerusalem
at Clerkenwell, which was burnt by the insurgents because of their
hostility to Robert HaleS, the Master of the Hospital, then Treasurer
of the kingdom. Walsingham says that the fire continued here sor
seven days.

933—936. Ovid, Fasti, vi. 439 ff„ where the reference is to the burn-
ing of the temple os Vesta. Hence the mention of sacred lires, which
is not appropriate here.

937. Metam. ii. 61.

939 f. Metam. i. 288f.

941 ff. This accusation, . which Gower brings apparently without
thinking it necessary to examine into its truth (‘ Est nichil vt queram,’
δια), is in direct contradiction to the statements of the chroniclerS, e.g.
Walsingharn, i. 456 fi, Knighton, ii. 135 ς but it is certain that dishonest
persons must have taken advantage of the disorder to some extent sor
their own private ends, however strict the commands of the leaders
may have been, and it is probable that the control which was
exercised at first did not long continue. ΤΙιο chroniclers agree with
Gower as to the drunkenness. ·

943f. ovid, Tmzet. v. 6. 39 f.
