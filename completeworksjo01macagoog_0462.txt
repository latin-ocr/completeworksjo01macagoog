The metrical fault produced by reading ‘ occultam . . . viam ⁹ seems to
have been corrected by the author, and in G the alteration has been made
by erasure, apparently in the first hand.

ι 44. redditus: apparently a substantive and practically equivalent to
‘ reditus.’

, 59. Ovid, Fasti, v. 21 3 f.‚ where however we bave ‘ Saepeque digestos?
It is difficult to say exactly what our author meant by ‘ Ο quia!

67. Cp. Metam. xiii. 395.

79 f. Speculum Stultorum, p. 47, ll. 9f. (ed. Wright, Rolls Series, 59,
vol. i.).

81. irriguis. Perhaps rather ‘ Fontibus irriguus, fecundus,’ as given
by most of the MSS.

131. adymum, ‘to that low place,’ i. e. his bed.

135. Non ita . . . Quin magar: cp. ll. 264 ff„ 331 ff„ 442 ff, 499ff, διε.
This form of sentence is a very common one with our author and
appears also in his F rench and English : cp. Mirour, 18589, Balades,
vii. 4, xviii. 2, xxx. 2, Cous: Amantis, i. 718, 1259, 1319, &c.

For example, Bal. xviii. 2,

‘ Tiel esperver crieis unqes ne fu,
Qe jeo ne crie plus en rna manieress

Cous. Amanus, i. 718 ff„

‘ So lowe cowthe 1 nevere bowe

To seigne humilite withoute‚

That mene leste betre loute

With alle the thoghtes of myn herte.'

It is most frequent in Latin, however, and the F rench and English
forms seem to be translations of this idiom with ‘ quin.³ ι

152. ‘ Dreams cast the soul into wanderings ἐ ⁸ ruunt’ is transitive,
as very commonly, and apparently we must take ‘vaga nonnulla'
together.

155. grauis et palpebra, &c., ‘ and my heavy eyelid unclosed
pondered over troubles, but no help came.’ This is the best translation
I can give, but the explanation of ‘ ex oculis ' as ‘ away from the eyes'
must be regarded as doubtful.

168. That is, ,οτι a Tuesday. It would be apparently Tuesday‚
June 11, 1381. The festival of Corpus Christi referred to afterwards
(see 1. 919), when the insurgente entered London, fell on June 13.

201. Burnellus: a reference to the Speculum Stultorum, p. 13
(Rolls Series, 59, vol. i).

2o5ff. Cp. Speculum Stultorum, p. 13, whence several of these lines
are taken.

211 f. ‘ They care not for the tail which He who gave them their ears
implanted in them, but think it a vile thing! The former line of the
couplet is from Speculum Stultorum, p. 15, l. 17.

213 f. Speculum Stultorum, p. 15, ll. 23 f.

255. caudas similesque draconum, ‘ and tails like those of dragous?
