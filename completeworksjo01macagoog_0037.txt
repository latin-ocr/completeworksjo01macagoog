LIFE OF GOWER xxv .

and he found confirmation of the theory that this was Gower the
poet from the fact that Great Braxted is near to Wigborough‚ where.
as we have seen, a person of this name, supposed by Professor
Morley to be the poet, had some claim to rent. We have already
seen reason to think that the John Gower who had a rent of ,gro
from Wigborough was not the poet, and in any case it is evident
that the fact could have nothing to do with a presentation by the
king five and twenty years afterwards to the rectory of Groet
Braxted. As to resignation with a view to marriage, it is very
unlikely, if not altogether out of the question, that a clergyman
who had held an important rectory for six or seven years should
not only have been permitted to marry, but should have had his
marriage celebrated in the Priory of St. Mary Overy and with the
particular sanction of the bishop of winchester. Add to this the
fact that John Gower the poet was undoubtedly ‘ Esquire‚’ being
called so not only on his tomb but also in the documents of 1382
and 1393, the latter belonging to the period when, according to
this theory, he was holding the living of Great Braxted. On the
whole, the ‘minor orders ’ theory must be dismissed as entirely
baseloes, and the John Gower who was rector of Great Braxted
must be set down as another of the rather numerous persons of
this name who were to be found in Kent and Essex at this time.
There is nothing in Gower's writings to suggest the idea that
he was an ecclesiastic. He distinctly calls himself a layman in
the M’rour de l’omme, and the expression ‘ borel clerk ' in the
Prologue os the Confissio Amantis must be taken to mean the
same thing. The language which in the Vox Clamantis he uses
about rectors who fail to perform the duties of their office, makes
it almost inconceivable that he should himself have held a rectory
without qualifying himself for the performance of the service of
the Church even by taking priest's orders· Evidently Professor
Morley's idea of the poet as an Essex rector must go the
way of his previous attempt to establish him as a country gentle-
man at Otford. It is probable that he passed a considerable
part of his literary life in those lodgings within the Priory of

St. Mary Overey which are mentioned in his marriage licence and
in his wi111. ·
