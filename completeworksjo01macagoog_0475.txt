NOTES. Lm. 111. 425—1443 385·

11181. ovid, Ars Amat. iii. 595 f. (where we have ‘sequatur’).
The original application is to the effects of rivali-y in stimulating the
passion of lovers. For the use of‘ sequetur' here, apparently as
a subjunctive, compare 1. 1946, ‘Inueniet tardam ne sibi l'entus opem)

1118—1124. These lines are almost entirely borrowed from the
Aurora, (MS. Bodley 822) f. 21 νο.

1124.111 the Glasgow MS.‘ F st has been here altered to ‘ Et!
1145-1150.A1m0st verbatim from Aurora, f. 93 νο.

of the text, ‘ Nota hic quattuor neccessaria episcopm
1171 f. Cp. Aurora, f. 44 νῦ,

‘Est olei natura triplex, lucet, cybat, unguit3
Hec tria mitratum debet habere capud.’

1183 s. Cp. Aurora, f. 44 νο,

‘ Lux est exemplu, cibus est dum pascit egenos,

1376. The reading ‘ vngat vt’ is given by the Digby MS. and seems
almost necessary: cp. l. 1206.

1405. prece ruffi . . et albi, ‘ by reason os the petition os the red and
the white,’ that is, presumably, by the influence of gold and silver,
‘ dominis ’ in the next line being in a loose kind os apposition to a dative
case suggested by ‘ Annuit.’

1407. S has here in the margin, in a rather later hand, ‘contra
rectores Oxou!

sublevantem se.'

1432. The margin of S has here, in the same hand as at 1407,
‘ Nota rectores et studentes Oxon.'

1443. formalis, that is, ‘ eminent,’ from ⁶ forma’ meaning ‘rank ' 01·
‘ dignity,’ but here also opposed to ‘ materialis.’
