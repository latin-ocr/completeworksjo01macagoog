the king to take strong mensures against Warwick (Malverne,
1>- 105}

109. de puteo Michaelis, ‘ pf Michael de la Pool.' The same view
’ of the meaning of the name is taken in Sbakspere, 2 Hemy VI, iv.
1. 70, by the murderer of Wiuiam, dulte os Suffolk, son of this Michael,
‘ Pole, Pool, sir Pool, lord! Ay, kennel, puddle, sink.’

111 ff. This is Thomas Rushook, a Dominican, who was translated
from Llandaff to Chichester by the king’s special desire in 1385. He
had incurred much suspicion and odium as the king's confessor and
supposed private adviser. Walsingham sayS, ‘ipse sibi conscius fugam
iniit ⁹ (ii. 172); but he certainly appeared at the bar of Parliament
and was sentenced to forseiture of hisgoods (Rot. Parl. iii. 241, Mal·
verne, p. 156). ,

, 113. ata: alluding to his Dominican habit.

121 ff. Cp. Knigbtom ii. 25 5 s. An the five Appellants seem to have

entered the Tower, but the three spoken of here are of course the three

leaderS, referred to in l. 41 and afterwards. Knighton says that the “

king invited the five to stay for the night, but only the earls of Derby
and N ottingham accepted the invitation. The fact that Gower here
assigns no politieal action to his 11010 1110 ear! of Derby (who was under
twenty years old), but gives all the credit -to the three leaders, shows
clearly that the young Hem-y played a very subordinate part.

131. covnata: that is, ‘co-unata,’ meaning ‘assembled.’

133 ff. Cp. Knighton⁹ ii. 292.

141. senecta. Burley was then fifty-six years old.

142. This evidently means that the queen interceded for him3 cp.
chronique de la T raison, p. 9. Walsingham tells us only that the earl
of Derby tried to save Simon Burley and quarrelled with his uncle Glou-
cester on the subject. Burley had been the principal negotiator os the
marriage of Richard with Anne of Bohemia.

150. Walsingham says of him that he was ‘ab antiquo fallax et
fraudulentus!

152. Pons Aquilonis, ‘ Bridgenorth.’ Beauchamp was keeper of
Bridgenorth Castle (Rot. Pat„ 10 Rich. 11. pt. 2. m. 15), but it does
not appear from other sources that 110 had the title here given him by
Gower of ‘ 1131011 Bridgenorth.’ In 1387 110 was made a peer by patent
(the first instance of this) under the title of lord Beauchamp of Kidder·
minster.

154. Tribulus: i.e. N icholas Brembel (so called by Gower), called
Brembul or Brembyl by Knighton‚ Brambre byWalsingham and Brembre
or de Brembre in the Patent Rolls and Rolls of Parliament. Pre-
sumably he was of Brembre (Bramber), in the county of Sussex. He had
been Mayor of London last in 1386. Knighton says of him ‘ quem -
saepius rex fecerat maiorem praeter et contra voluntatem multorum
ciuium’ (ii. 272), and Walsingham declares that be had planned a
proscription of his opponents‚ with a view 10 making himself absolute
ruler of London with the title os duke (ii. 174).
