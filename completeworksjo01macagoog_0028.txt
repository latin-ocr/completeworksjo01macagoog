xvi INTRODUCTION

Forester, to be used during his absence abroad by licence of the
king ¹. Considering that Chaucer and Gower are known to have
been 'personally acquainted with one another, we may fairly
suppose that this appointment relates to John Gower the poet ⁸.

6 Ric. ΙΙ (Aug. 1382). Grant‘ of the manors of Feltwell in
Norfolk and Multon in Suffolk to John Gower, Esquire, of Kent,
and to his heirS, by Guy de Rouclyf, clerk (Aug. 1), and release
of warranty on the above (Aug. 3) ⁸.

6 Ric. ΙΙ (Aug. 1382). Grant of the manors of F eltwell and
Multon by John Gower to Thomas Blakelake, parson of
St. Nicholas, Feltwell, and others, sor his lise, at a rent of A 40,
to be paid quarterly in the Abbey Church of westminster ⁴. This
grant was repeated 7 Ric. 11 (Feb. 1384) ⁸.

The mention of Multon in the will of John Gower the poet
makes it practically certain that the above documents have to do
with him.

17 Ric. II (1393). Henry of Lanoester presented John Gower,
Esquire, with a collar. This was mentioned by N icolas as com-
.municated to him by Mr. G. F. Beltz from a record· m the Duchy
of Lancaster Office. No further reference was given, and 1 have
had some difficulty in finding the record. It ie, however, among
the accounts of the wardrobe of Henry of Lancaster for the year
mentioned ⁸, and though not dated, it probably belongs to some
time in the autumn of 139 3, the neighbouring documents in the
same bundle being dated October or November. It proves to be
in ‘fact an order, directed no doubt to William Loveney, clerk
of the Wardrobe to the earl of Derby, for delivery of 265. sd. to
one Richard Dancaster, sor a collar, on account of another collar
given by the earl os Derby to ‘an Esquire John Gower' ⁷. So
elsewhere in the household accounts os the earl of Derby we find
a charge of 565. 8d. for a silver collar for John Payne, butler,
