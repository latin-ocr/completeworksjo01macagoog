to do good. Powerful men escape without rebuke sor their sins, and
penance is avoided by payment.

CAP. 1v. As regards the ‘ positive law,’ for breach of which
dispensations are granted, 1 ask first whether Christ gives indulgence
beforehand sor sin, or prohibits that which is not sin. lf these things
are sins, how ean 1 be free to commit them on consideration of a
money payment3 if not, why does the Church forbid them? This is
merely a device for bringing in money to the clergy.

CAP- V. The poison of temporal possessions is still working in the
Chureh. They no longer war on the pagan, but turn their swords
against their own brother Christians.

CAP. VI. Christ left peace with his disciples, but in our time
avariae and ambition cause prelates to take part in intestine sti-ise, with
swords in their hands and the cross as their ensign. It is not the part
of a soldier to offer incense at the altar or of a priest to bear anns in
war.

CAP. v11. The priest should fight with other than material arms.
David was not permitted to build a house sor the Lord, because he had
been a shedder of blood; and those who are stained with the slaughter
of their brethren cannot be the true servants of the altar. Brotherly

sceptre to the Emperor3 the one must not usurp the rights of the
other. The Emperor should not claim spiritual power, nor the Pope
temporal. Christ is a lover of peace and his ministers must not appeal
to the sword, but must keep the command, ‘ Thou shalt not kill.¹ Let
Christ himself lay claim to what is his. Pride is the root of all evil.

The apostles conquered by prayers and by patience3 Peter had
neither silver nor gold, but he healed the lame man3 our clergy
abound in wealth, but do no works of healing, either spiritual or bodily.
Ο thou who art head of the Church‚ remember that forgiveness should
be until seventy times seven, and that Peter was commanded by Christ
to put up his sword.

CAP. X. The teaching and the writings of the clergy are in favour
of peace and love, and when I wondered why they waged wam, one
answered me in the person of the supreme pontiff and said: ‘ Rule on
earth is given to us by divine decree and it pleases us to enjoy all the
good things of this world. Our way is different from that of Christ
and his apostles ; we set up the cross as a sign of hatred and vengeance,
we put to death those who will not acknowledge our rule; the pastoral
