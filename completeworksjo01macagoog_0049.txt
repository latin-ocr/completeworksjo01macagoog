the day in which the peasant shall drive out the lord3 let honour, law
and virtue perish, and let our court mle: They listen and approve,
and though they know not what ‘ our court ’ meanS, what he says has
for them the force of law: if he says ‘ strike,’ they strike, if he says
‘ki11,’ they kin. Their sound was as the sound os the sea, and from
terror 1 could scarcely move my feet. They strike a mutual compact
and declare that all those of gentle blood who remain in the world shall
be overthrown.

‘rhen they advance all togethe13 a dark cloud mingled with the
fin-ies of hell rains down evil into their hearts; the earth is wetted with
the dew of the pit, so that no virtue can grow, but every vice increases.
Satan is loose and among them, the princes of Erebus draw the world
after them, and the more 1 gaze, the more 1 am terrified, not knowing
what the end will be.

CAP. X. Furious rage there waS, they were greedy for slaughter
like hungry wolves. The seven races derived from Cain were ‘added
to them. The prophets spoke of them, Gog and Magog is their name,
they neither sear man nor worship God. Moreover those companions
of Ulysses, whom Circe mnsfomed, are associated with them: some
have the heads of men and others of brute beasts.

CAP. XI. There is Wat, Tom and Sim, Bet and Gib followed by
Hick, con, Geff and will, Grigge, Dawe, Hobbe and Lorkin, Hudd,
Judd, Tebb and Jack, such are their names31and Ball teaches them as
a prophet, himself having been taught by the devil.

Some bray like asser», others bellow like bulls, they grunt, they bark,
they howl, the geese cackle‚ the wasps buzz· , the earth is terrified with
their sound and trembles at the name of the Jay.

CAP. XII. They appoint hemlds and leaders, and they order that
all who do not favour them shall suffer death. They are armed with
staltes and poles, old bows and arrows, rusty sickles, mattocks and
forks3 some have only clods and stones and branches of trees. They
wet the· earth with the blood of their betterS.

CAP. XIII. These come in their fury to the city of new Troy, which

² Fuller's spirited translation of these lines is well known, but may'here
be quoted again:

‘Tom comes thereat, when calle⁰d by Wat, and Simm as forward we find,
Bet calls as quick to Gibb and to Hykk, that neither would tan-y behind.
Gibb, a good whelp of that litter, doth help mad Con more mischief to do,
And will he does vow, the time is come now, he'll join in their company too.
Davie complains„ whiles Grigg gets the gains, and Hobb with them does

partake,
Lorkin aloud in the midst os the crowd conceiveth as deep is his stake.
Hudde doth spoil whom J udde doth soil, and Tebb lends his helping hand,
But Jack the mad patch men and houses does snatch, and kius all at his
command) (Ἄκη-11 His-eom, Book iv. (p. 139).
