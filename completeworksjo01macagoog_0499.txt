NOTES. PARS l. 158-11. 121 409

69f. In the Annales Ricardi II it is definitely stated that Warwick
came to the king’s banquet and was attested after it (p. 202). Accord-
ing ιο Gower's account there was no banquet at all, and Gloucester
was arrested before Warwick; and this agrees with the accounts given
in the chronique de la T raison, p. 9, and by Froissart, vol. xvi. p. 73
(ed. Lettenhove). ,

85ff. From this account we should gather that the king officially
announced the death of the duke of Gloucester to parliament before it
had occurred3 but this was not so. Parliament met on Sept. 17, and
on Sept. 21 a writ was sent in the king’s name to Calais, ordering the
earl of Nottingham to produce his prisoner. This was replied to,
under date Sept. 24, with the announcement that he was dead (Rot.
Parl. iiij 378). It is certain, however, that a report of the duke of
Gloucester’s death was circulated and generally believed in the month

. of August, and equally certain that this was done with the connivance

of the king, who probably wished to try what effect the news would
produce upon the public mind. Sir William Rickhill, the justice who
was sent over to extract a confession from the duke of Gloucester,
received on Sept. 5 a commission from the king to proceed to Calais,
no purpose stated, the date of the commission being Aug. 17. On
arrival he was presented by the earl of Nottingham with another
commission from the king, also with date Aug. 17, directing him to
examine the duke of Gloucester. He expressed surprise, saying that
the duke was dead and that his death had been ‘ notified ’ to the people
both at Calais and in England. On the next day he saw the duke
and received his so·called confession (Rot. Parl. iii. 431). When this
confession was communicated to parliament, the date of it was sup-
pressed, and things were so arranged as to favour the opinion that the
interview with Rickhill took place between the 17th and 2 sth of August,
the latter being the accepted date of Gloucester’s death ς cp. the article
by Mr. James Tait in the Dict. osNational Biograplty, vol. lvi. pp. 157 f.

It is probable enough that the duke of Gloucester was still living
when parliament met, as Gower seems to imply. · Unfortunately John
Halle, who confessed that he was present at the murder of the duke
(Rot. Parl. iii. 45 3), gave no precise date. The statement of Gower
that the king waited until he had secured his condemnation‚ may mean
only that he satisfied himself of the temperof Parliament before taking
the final and irrevocable step.

101 ff. The body seems first to have been laid in the Priory of
Bermondsey τ thenit was buried by Richard’s command in westminster
Abbey‚ but apart from the royal bustal-place. Afterwards the body was
transferred by Henry lv to the place chosen by Gloucester himself,
between the tomb of Edward the Confessor and that of Edward 111
(Adam of Usk, p. 39).

121 f. For the insults levelled against the earl of Arundel see Ann.
Ric. JI, p. 215, Adam of Usk‚ p. 13.

with regard to the events of this parliament generally, it is worth.
