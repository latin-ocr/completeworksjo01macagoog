lxxvi GOWER’S LATIN WORKS

Of the above errors several, as we have said, are reproduced by·
Wright with no authority from his MS. ², but otherwise. his text is
a tolerably correct representation of that given by the Cotton MS„
and the same may be said with regard to the other poems Carmen
super multiplici Via’omm Pestilencztx, De Lucis Scmtim'o ², &c-

Trra Pansam· Enrrrorz. The text is in the main that of S,
which is supplemented‚ where it is defective, by C. The Cotton
MS. is also the leading authority for those pieces which are not
contained in S, as the four last poems.

For the Vox Clamant& four manuscripts have been collated
with S word for word throughout, viz. CHDL, and two more, viz.
GE, have been collated generally and examined for every doubtful
passage. ΤΗ, have been carefully examined and taken as authorities
for the original text of some of the revised passages.

As regards the record of the results of these rather extensive
collations, it may be* stated generally that all material variatione
of C and H from the text of S have been recorded in the critical
notes ⁸. The readings of E, D and L have been printed regularly
for those passages in which material variations of other MSS. are
recorded, and in such cases, if they are not mentioned, it 'may be
assumed that they agree with S; but otherwise they are mentioned
only when they seem to deserve attention. The readings of G are
recorded in a large number of instances‚ but they must not be
assumed ex silentio, and those of T and H, are as a mle only
given in passages where they have a different version of the text.

A trifling liberty has been taken with the text of the MSS. in
regard to the position of the con junction ‘ que ' (and). This is

¹ e. g. i. 909 Regem 919 Qui est ii. 9 sociatus 114 de pondere

966 Pontifice.

² A few error-s may be noted in the poem Da Lucis somniate, viz. Ι. 15
manifestus 36 oculis 66 similatam 89 Ominis (jor Ο nimis) z
also in ‘ Ο deus imnrense,’ 1. 98 se (sor te) 104 sub (ἡν sue).

³ ’rrissing differentes of spelling are as a rule not recorded. Examples of
such variations are the following in C ε i. 1 ut 11 uidet 93 choruscabat
190 talamum 137 sydera 139 themone 141 διο. sed (for set)
196 διο. amodo 934 prohdolor 311 Immundos 586 Egiptus
1056 Symonis 1919 Ocupat 1995 suppremis 1505 loquturus
1514 Obstetit 1755 opprobrium 1839 littora 19471itora 9094 patiens
ii. Ptol. 11 069111 ii. 57 fatie 961 Μοὶεο 494 synagoga iii. 991 red-
ditus, &c. variation in the use of capital letters or in regard to the separation
of ‘ que? ‘ ve‚’ &e from the words which they follow is usually not recorded.
The spelling of H and G is almost identieal with that of S.
