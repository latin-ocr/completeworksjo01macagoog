LII-'E OF GOWER xxi

is suspended bearing arma, argent, on a chevron azure three
leopards’ faces or, erest a talbot (or lion) upon a chapeau. The
wall behind the tomb under the canopy is at present blank5 the
original painting of female figures with ἔοι-0113 has disappeared
and has not been renewed, nor has the inscription ‘ Armigeri
scutum ,’ δῖα, been replaced.

This tomb has attracted much attention, and descriptions of it
exist from early times. Leland's account may be thus translated:
⁴ He was honourably buried in London in the church of the
Marian canons on the bank os the Thames‚ and his wife also is
buried in the same place, but in a lower tomb. He has here an
effigy adorned with a gold chain and a chaplet of ivy interspersed
with roseS, the first marking him as a knight and the second as
a poet. The reason why he established his place of burial here,
was, I·believe‚ as follows, A large part of the suburb adjacent
to London Bridge was burnt down in the year 1212 ¹, in the reign
of King John. The monastery of the Marian canons was much
damaged in this fire and was not fully restored till the first year of
Richard ΙΙ. At that time Gower, moved by the calamity, partly
through his friends, who were numerous and powersul, and partly
at his own expense, repaired the church and restored its orna-
ments, and the Marian canons even now acknowledge the

· liberality of Gower towards them, though not to such an extent

as I declare it to have been. For this reason it was, in my
judgement‚ that he left his body for burial to the canons of this
house ¹.' Berthelette in the Presace to his edition of the Confisse‘o
Amantes, 15 32, gives an interesting acco'unt of the tomb: ‘John
Gower prepared sor his bones a testing-place in the monastery of
St. Mary Overes‚ where somewhat after the old sashion he lieth
right sumptuously buried, with a garland on his head in token
that he in his lise days flourished freshly in literature and science.
And the same moniment, in remembrance of him erected, is on
the North side of the soresaid church, in the chapel of St. John,
where he hath of his own foundation a mass daily sung: and
moreover he hath an obit yearly done for him within the same
church on the Friday aster the feast os the blessed pope St. Gregory.

² Perhaps rather ¹207 or 1208.

² Scapt. Brit. i. 415: so also Ant. coll. iv. 79, where the three books are
mentioned. The statement that the chaplet was partly of ivy must be a
mistake, as is pointed out by Stow and others.
