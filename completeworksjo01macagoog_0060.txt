xlviii GOWER’S LATIN WORKS

of men nor endure the rule of the law: they toil not, neither do they
spin, and yet the world feeds them. It is vain for them to plead the
merits of Francis, when they do not follow his example. Au honour to
those who do as he did.

CAP. XXI. They draw into their order not grown men but mere
boys. Francis was not a boy when he assumed his work; but in these
days mere children are enrolled, caught like birds in a snare: and as
they are deceived themselveS, so afterwards they deceive others.

CAP. XXII. The friar who transgresses the rule of his order is an
apostate and a follower of the apostate flend. He finds entrance every·
where, and everywhere he lays suares, encourages hatred, and foster-0.
impurity. Under a veil os virtuous simplicity he conceals a treachetous
beart. These are ministers of the Synagogue rather than of the Church‚
children of Hagar, not of Sara.

CAP. XXIII. They are dispersed over the world like the Jews, and
everywhere they find ease and abundance. Their churches and their
houses are built in the most costly style and adorned with the richest
ornaments. No kihg has chambers more magnificent than theirs, and
their buildings are a mark of their worldly pride. Unless their souls
are fair within, this outward pomp οἱ religion is of no avail.

CAP. XXIV. Friars differ from one another in the garb of their
order, but all equally neglect their rule. Only the order founded by
brother Burnel still maintains its former state. Two rules of this
order Iwill set forth, which are almost everywhere received. The first
is that what the flesh desires‚ that you may have ; and the second that
whatever the flesh shrinks from, that you should avoid. So the new
order of Burnel is thought better than those of Benedict or Bernard.

Thus, ishad times come, 1 shall hold that the error of the Clergy is
the cause. The body is nothing without the spirit: we have darkness
instead of light, death instead of life, and the flock is scattered abroad
without a shepherd.

LIBER Qum'rUS.

CAP. 1. 1 will speak in the second place of the order of Knighthood.
This was established first to defend the Church‚ then for the good of
the community, and thirdly to support the cause of the widow and
orphan. If a knight persor-ms these duties, he should have praise, but
not if he makes war merely for the sake of glory.

If a knight overcornes his enemies, but is overcome by the love of
a woman, he has no true glory‚ for he makes himself a slave instead
of free.

CAP. II. If the knight would reflect on the variety and uncertainty
of love, he would not allow himself so easily to be made captive.

CAP. III. But when he sees beauty in woman decked out with all
its charms, he thinks it divine and marvellouS, and he can offer no
