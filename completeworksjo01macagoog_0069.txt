he will by his own life. ¹ But this 1 say, that sin committed and not
purged by repentance receives at length its due reward.

The conclusion of the Vox Clamanttk, as altered from the first
version, is doubtless intended as a fitting form os introduction for
the Crom‘ca Ihpertita, which comes in as an appendix added in
later years. 1t will be noted as regards the prose which forms
a transition to this, that Gower has in the end brought himself to
think that the misfortunes os the earlier part of Richard's reign
were intended as a special warning to the youthful king, whom he
formerly relieved from responsibility on account of his tendet age,
and that the tyranny os his later time sprang naturally out of
his disregard of this preliminary chastisement. This change of
view is also to be traced in the successive forms assumed by the
paragraph relating to the Vox clamantis· in the author's account
of his books (‘ Quia vnusquisque,’ δια). .

Of the contents of the Cronica Tnpertita it is unnecessary that
more should be said than is contained in the Notes to this edition.
Of tbe remaining pieces the Carmen super myltiplici Via-iorum
Pestilentia is dated by the author as belonging to the twentieth
year of Richard 11. The Tractatus de Lucis Scrutim'o is probably
somewhat later, and the poem ‘ O deus immense‚’ δια, is said in
one of the titles prefixed to have been composed near the end of
Richard’s reign. Besides these there is a group of Latin poems
referring to the accession of Henry IV, ‘ Rex celi, deuS,’ ὅτε.
adapted from the Vox Clamantir, ‘H. aquile pulluS,’ and ‘O reco-
lende, bone,’ with several short occasional pieces belonging to the
la‘st years of the author’s life. One of these has reference to his
blindness and to the end os his activity as an author which was
caused by it, and in connexion with this we have also the epistle
to Archbishop Arundel prefixed to the All Souls MS. of the Vox
clamantis· and other Latin poernS, and apparently meant to
accompany the presentation of this particular copy. To Arundel
also is addressed the short piece referring to the comet of March
1402, and finally we have the lines in which allusion is made to
the short-comings of executore. It is probable also that the
four lines which afterwards appeared upon the poet's tomb,
‘ Armigeri scutum,’ &c.‚ and which are given by the Glasgow MS„
were written by Gower himself.

¹ In the first version, ‘1 am myself the worst of sinuers, but may God
grant me relies by his Spirit.’
