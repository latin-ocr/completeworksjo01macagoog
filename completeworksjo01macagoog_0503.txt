NOTES. PARS 111. 35-276 413

shortly to recall the duke of N orsolk (p. 23). It is noteworthy that ὃ
Gower makes no mention whatever of the duke of N orfolk here.

128 (margin). It cannot os course be supposed that Henry embarked
at Calais. Probably he sailed from Boulogne. Froissart says that
his port of departure was Vannes. in Brittany, but he expresses some
uncevtainty about the matter, and his whole account here is hopelessly
inaccurate (xvii. 171, ed. Kervyn de Lettenhove).

137. nepote: that is Thomas, son of the late earl of Arundel; see
l. 130, margin. ι

160 ff. The suggestion here that Richard foresaw the coming of
Henry and went to Ireland through sear of it, is of course absurd. At
the same time it is certain that he received warningS‚ and that in view
of these his expedition to Ireland was very ill-timed. The statement
in the margin, that he fatally wasted time in Ireland, is supported both
by the English annalists and by Creton. ln the Annales Ric. II we
read that a week was wasted by Richard’s hesitation as to the port
from which he should sail ( p. 248), and Creton says that Richard was
delayed by the treacherous advice of the duke of Aumerle, who in-
duced him to leave the levying of troops in Wales to the earl of Salisbury ·
and to embark at his leisure at Waterford (Archaeologia, xx. 312).
Nothing is said of unfavourable winds in any of these authorities, except
that Creton observes that the news os Henry's landing was delayed by

the bad weather (p. 309). Henry landed July 4, and Richard was in
Wales before the end of the mouth.

188. There is no authority for reading ‘ sceleris’ in this line, as the
former editors have done. Presumably ‘ sceleres ’ is for ‘celeres,’ and
this form of spelling is found occasionally elsewhere in the MSS„ as
conversely ‘ceptrum ’ frequently for ‘ sceptrum! It is not easy to
translate the line, whatever reading we may adopt. It seems to
mean ‘So in their ignorance they hesitate,’ (‘ few show themselves
quick in action’).

205. mundum nec abborruit istum, ‘ nor renounced this world ⁹:
‘ istum,’ as usual, for ‘ hunc.’

244. Augusti mensis, Richard left F lint on Aug. 19, and arrived in
London Sept. 2 (Annales Ric. II, p. 251).

256. Humsredum natumz that is Humphrey, the young son of the
duke of Gloucester. Richard had taken him to Ireland, and on hear-
ing of the landing of Henry had ordered him to be confined, together
with young Henry of lancaster, in Trim castle (Walsingham, ii. 233).

272. transit mon'ens. He died apparently on the way back from
Ireland, in Anglesea according to Adam of Usk‚ who says that he was
poisoned (p. 28). Walsingham says that he died of ‘pestilente’ (ii. 242):
cp. Annales Henrici JV, p. 321 (Rolls Series, 28. 3).

276. Cigtms: apparently the young duke of Gloucester is here meant,
and it is not intended to state that he was killed by grief for the loss of
his father, but that his mother died of grief for him: cp. Annales
Henn‘a' I V, p. 321.
