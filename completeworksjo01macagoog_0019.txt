INTRODUCTION

LIFE OF GOWER.

To write anything like a biography of Gower, with the materials
that exist, is an impossibility. Almost the only authentic records
of him, apart from his writingS, are his marriage-licence, his will,
and his tomb in St. Saviour³s Church; and it was this last which
furnished most of the material out of which the early accounts of
the poet were composed. A succession of writers from Leland
down to Todd contribute hardly anything except guesswork, and
this is copied by each from his predecessors with little or no
pretence of criticism. Some of thern, as Berthelette and Stow, κ
describe from their own observation the tomb with its effigy and
inscriptions, as it actually was in their time, and these descriptions
supply us with positive information of some value, but the rest is
almost entirely worthless.

Gower’s will was printed in Gough’s Sepulchral Monuments
(1796), and in 1828 Sir Harris NicoIaS‚ roused by the uncritical
spirit of Todd, published the article in the Retrospective Review'
which has ever since been regarded as the one source of authentic
information on the subJect. It does not appear that Nicolas
undertook any very extensive searching of records, indeed he seems
to have practioelly confined his attention to the British Museum 3
for wherever he cites the Close Rolls or other documents now in
the Record Office, it is either from the abstract of the Close Rolls
given in MS. Harl. 1176 or as communicated to him by some
other person: but he was able to produce several more or less
interesting documents connected either with the poet or with
somebody who bore the same name and belonged to the same family,
and he placed the discussion sor the first time upon a sound
mitical basis. Pauli simply recapitulated the results arrived at by
N idolas with some slight elucidations from the Close Rolls of
