LIFE OF GOWER xxiii

from which it would appear that we cannot depend even upon the
festines of the effigy which now exists, as original.

The figures of the virgins were repainted in the course of the
seventeenth century apparently, for in Hatton’s Nem Vr‘ew of
London (date 1708) they are described as appearing with ⁴ duoal
coronets ¹.’ In Rawlinson's Natural Histoov and Antiquities qf
Surrey (published 1719) the effigy is spoken of as having a
‘scarlet gown,’ the older descriptions, e. g. Stow, giving it as ‘an
habit of purple damasked‚' and it is said that there is upon the
head ⁸ a chaplet or diadem of gold about an inch broad, on which
are set at equa] distances four white quatersoyles) ⁸ The writer

arms as pendent by the dexter corner. The figures of women
have ducal coronets and scrolls of gold, and below them is the
epitaph ⁸ Armigeri scutum.’ Under the statue the inscription
‘ Hic iacet,’ δια· The monument, as here described, is engraved
in Gough's Sepulchral Monuments (date 1 796), where there is
a full description of it ⁶. Blore‚ under whose direction the
position of the monument was changed, says in 1826 tha't the
inscription on the ledge · of the tomb ⁸ Hic iacet,’ δια, was then
