NOTES. Lm. VI. 816-1323 401

1107-1112. De Vita Monachmm, p. 193.

1115 f. De Vita Monachornm, p. 183.

1159* ff. That this was the text which stood originally in S is proved
partly by the fact that the original heading of the chapter stands still
as given here in the Table of Chapters, f. 5, aud also by the traces of
original coloured initials at 11. 1 175 and 1199. A considerable part of

the erased chapter reappears in the poem ‘Rex celi deus) &c., ad-
dressed to Henry IV: see p. 343.

1189 f. Si tibi . . . cupias conuertere . . . Te. These words appear in

S as a correction of the rewritten text by a second erasure and in
another hand.

Cap. xix. Heading. The original form, as given by DLTH2, is still
to be found in the Table of Chapters in S.

1201. Cp. Ovid, Metam. vii. 585 s.,

1205. Metam. ii. 541.

1223. Oza, that is Uzzah (2 Sam. vi.)‚ who is selected as a type of
carnal lust,apparently on the strength os the quite gratuitous assumption
adopted in Lib. 111. 1885 ff. Apparently ‘ luxus' in the n‘ext line is
genitive, in spite of the metre z ep. ‘ excercitus,’ i. 609, ‘ ducatus,’ Cron.
Trzss. iii. 1 17.

1236. Giesi, i. e. Gehazi.
