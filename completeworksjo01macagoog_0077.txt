MAN USCRI PTS lxv

Tnssertita, &c- The last quire of that book, ff. 158-164 (one leaf lost
at the end), has several blanks (162. 163, 164 vo).

In a good many instances passages os from two to six lines are
omitted in the text and inserted in the margin, either across or at the
bottom of the page, in a hand which seems not to be that of the text,

though very similar, and is probably identical with S (1). This occurs ⁹

on ff. 41, 74, 76, 78, &c.

The text 01· H is very correct, and in forma of spelling, 810. it closely
resemble· that ot* S. There is little punctuation at first, but more aster·
warda. In form of text it agrees nearly'with C, but (1) the marginal note
at iv. 587 ia omitted, (a) as regards revision H parta company with'C at vi.
1219, from which point H has the unreviaed text in agreement with EDTH.
except in the concluding linea of the Vox Clamanti-5 on f. 134, which, as
already remarked, are rewritten in a new hand.

The hands of H may be thus distinguished: ·

(1) Text of the Vox clumam, a good and regular sourteenthaeentury

(a) Panga added in the margin, probably the name aa S (1).

(3) Rewritten text of i. 1019 ff. , vi. 545-580, vi. cap. xviii and' heading of
xix, last lines of Vox Clamantnk, text of Crom'ca Tn'pertr‘ta and succeeding
piecea to the end of ‘ Ο deus immense' f. 159 v⁰. This ia the same aa S (a),

G {zg'sseffitten text of iii. 1 ff„ corrections os iv. 1212, 1⁹14» and rewritten

a bow to shoot at the world, with the lines ‘Ad mundum mitto‚’ &c.,
as in the Cotton and Glasgow MSS„ but the figure and features are
different, and evidently the picture has less claim to be considered
an authentic portrait than those of the two MSS. above named.
