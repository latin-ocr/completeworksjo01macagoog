357-359. T hese three lines are from the Pantheon, p. 9.

371-374. Taken with slight change from the Pantheon, p. 10.

377 f. From Aurora, (MS. Bodley 822) f. 7 νο.

414. ‘'rhat which the new star brings argues that he is God:

423. That is, ‘ Lux venit, vt obscurari possit tenebris,’ διο.

485. ‘ Every one who thinks upon Jesus ought to resolve to lay
aside,’ διε.

487. The MSS. give ‘ benedicti‚’ but it seems probable that ‘benedici ¹
was meant. The verb is commonly transitive in later Latin.

495 ff. .Cp. Isaiah, xliv. 9-20.

531 f. Psalms, cxiii. 8.

619 ff. Cp. ovid, Metam. i. 74 ff.

LIB. 111. PRoLocus.

11 ff. The author characteristioelly takes care to point out that m
his criticism of the Church he is expressing not his own private
opinion, but the‘ commune dictum? the⁶ repert which went abroad
among the people‚ and the‘ vox populi' has for him always a high
authority. Cp. Mirour de l'Omnm, 18445 ff„ 19057 ff„ and see belom
l. 1267 ff„ iv. 19 f„ 709 s.

With what is said in this Book of the condition of the Church and the
clergy we may compare the author-'s Mitmerdc I’Omme, 18421-20832.

25 f. Compare with this the author’s note on Mirour de somme,
21266-78.

61. Cp. Ovid, Pont. iv. ¹4· 41.

64. Cp. Pont. iv. 9. 10.

67f. Cp. Tristia, ii. 301 f.

82. Cp. Pont. ii. 2. 128.

LIB. 111.

1-28. The form of these lines which stood originally in S is given by
the Trinity College, Dublin‚ and the Hatfield MSS. The passage has
been rewritten over erasure in C HG, and it must be lest doubtful what
text they had originally. From the fact that the erasure in G begins
with the second line, it may seem more probable that the original text
of this manuscript agreed with that which we have now in S, rather
than with TH2: sor in the latter case there would have been no need
to begin the erasure before 1. 4. In CH the whole passage has been
recopied (the same hand appearing here in the two MSS.) so that we ,
can draw no conclusion about the point where divergence actually began.
EDL have the same text by first hand. It will be noted that the lines
as given by ΤΗ, make no mention of the schism of the Papacy.

11 ff. With this we may compare Mirour de l’Omme‚ 18769 ff.

22. nisi, for ‘nil nisi’: cp. l. 32.

41. Cp. ovid, Amores, iii. 8. 55.
