LIFE OF GOWER xxvii

He takes pains to point out, both in this poem and in the Vox
Clementis, the utility os their occupatiom and the justice of their
claim to reasonably large profits on successful ventures in con-
sideration of the risks they run (mmm, 2 5177 θὶς Vox Clam.
Lib. v. Cap. xi, Heading). He makes a special apology to the
honest members os the class for exposing the abuses to which the
occupatiori is liable, pleading that to blame the bad is in effect to
praise the good (2 52 1 3 ff„ 2 597 5 fit), and he is more careful here
than elsewhere to point out the fact that honest members of the
class exist. He speaks os ‘our City,’ and has strong feelings
about the interests of the city os London, and about the pro-
ceedings of a certain bad citizen who stirs up strise and aims at
giving privileges in trade to strangers (Mrour, 26 380 ff. ; cp. Vox
clamantis, v. 835 ff.): moreover, the jealousy of Lornbards which
he expresses has every appearance of being a prejudice connected
with rivalry in commerce (25429 fit). He has a special en-
thusiasm about the wool-trade, as a national concern of the first
importatum, and he has very definite opinions about the abuses

of the staple (2 5360 fit). At the same time there is no definite ³

evidence that Gower was a merchant, and his interest in trade

and in the affairs of the city of London may well have arisen Ἴ.

from his residence in or near the city and his personal acquaintance
with merchants (cp. Mir. 25915 nt). His references to the
dearness of labour and the unreasonable demands of the labourer
(24625 ff.) are what we might expect from a man who bad
property in land3 but again we have no sufficient evidence
that Gower was a land-owner in the ordinary sense of the
word, for, though he acquired the mauors os Feltwell and Multon, he
did not reside upon either os them, but gave a lease of them at once.

He tells us that he is a man of simple tastes (2⁶²93 ff.)‚ and
we know from the whole tone of his writings that he is a just and
upright man, who believes in the subordination of the various
members of society to one another, and who will not allow
himself to be ruled in his· own household either by his wife or his
servants, But, though a thorough believer in the principle of
gradation in human society, he constantly emphasizes the equality
os all men before God‚ and refuses absolutely to admit the
accident of birth as constituting any claim to ‘gentilesce.’ The
common descent of all from Adam is as conclusive on this point
sor him as it was for John Ball. - Considering that his views
