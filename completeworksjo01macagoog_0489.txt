NOTES. Lm. VI. 337-793 399

545-580. It is certain that the passage preserved to us in the Dublin
and Hatfield MSS. is that which was originally written in those books
which now exhibit an erasure; sor in several places words are legible
underneath the present text of these latter MSS. For example in S
‘ maior ’ is visible as the last word of the original l. 547, and ‘ locuta,’
‘aula‚’ similarly in ll. 549, 551. The chief difference introduced is in
the direction of throwing more responsibility on the king, who however
is still spoken of as a boy. Thus instead of ‘ Stat puer immunis culpe,’
we have ‘ Rex puer indoctus morales negligit actus ’ (or more strongly
still ⁴ respuit ’).

The text of 545*-580* follows the Dublin MS. (T) with corrections
from Hs. Neither text is very correct: both omit a word in l. 549*,
which 1 supply by conjecture, and both read ‘ omnes ’ in l. 561 ⁴¹.
There are some obvious errors in T, as ‘sinis ’for ‘ sinit' in 1. 5 54*,
⁸ Tempe’ sor ‘ Tempora’ in l. 5 59*, which have been passed over
without notice.

Cap. viii. Heading. The ensuing Epistle to the young king, which
extends as far as 1. 1200, assumes a more severely moral form owing to
the alteration of the preceding passage, the exclusion os all complitnent
(‘ regnaturo ’ in this heading for ‘ excellentissimo ⁹) and the substitution of
doctrine causa ’ for ‘in eius honore! (The readings ‘ excellentissim0,’
‘in eius honore ⁹ no doubt are to be found in the Hatfield MS.,
but 1 have accidentally omitted to take note os them.)

629 f. Neekam, De Vita Monackorum, p. 185,

‘ Quid tibi nobilitas et clarum nomen avorum,
Si vitiis servus sactus es ipse tuis?’

640. ‘ vix ’ is sometimes used by our author (apparently) in the sense
ί 2

οἱ ὃξὲειέξᾷἰό, Rem. Amoris, 526.
710. iudiciale, ‘judgement,’ used as a substantive: cp. iii. 1692.
718. culpe . . . sue, ‘ for their fault,’ i. e. the fault of his ministerS.
719-722. Cp. Aurora, (MS. Bodley 822) f. 65,

‘ Euolat ancipiter ad prede lucra, suisque
Deseruit dominis in rapiendo cybum.

Sic multi dominis famulando suiS, ad eorum
N utum pauperibus dampna ferendo nocent.’

725. presul, ‘ the bishop.'

740. The expression ‘ Cuius enim ’ for ‘ Eius enim ’ occurs more
than once, e. g. 1. 1238: ἐρ. vii. 372. It is found also in the Con-
' sessio A mannis, Latin Verses aster vii. 1984, but was there corrected
in the third recension.

765. stabiles: apparently used in a bad sense.

793 f. Cp. Aurora, f. 96 v0,
⁴ Exiguus magnum vicit puer ille Golyam,
N am virtus humilis corda superba domat.'
