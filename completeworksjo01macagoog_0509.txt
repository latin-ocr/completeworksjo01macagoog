NOTES 419

evils and the final catastrophe had been brought about. It has already
been pointed out (vol. iii. p. 530) that in the Fairfax MS. this account
of the author-’s books is completely separated from the text of the

Confessio Amantis- and is written in a later hand, the same in fact
which we have here in the An Souls MS.

ENEIDOS BUCOLIS ETc. (p. 361)

These lines, which Gower says were kindly sent to him by ‘ a
certain philosopher’ (not ‘ quidam Philippus,’ as printed by the
Roxburghe editor) on the completion of his three books, are found also
at the end of the F aii-fax MS. The author is probably the same as
that of the four lines ‘ Quam cinxere freta,’ δια, appended to the
Confessio Amantis, which are called ‘ Epistola super huius opusculi
sui complementum Iohanni Gower a quodam philosopho transmissa!
1 have ventured on the conjecture that this philosopher was in fact
Ralph Strode, whom Chaucer couples with Gower in the last stanza of
Troilus with the epithet ‘ philosophical,’ and os whom we know by
tradition that he wrote elegiae verse.

Ο DEUS IMMENSE ETC. (p. 362)

There is no reason why the heading should not be from the hand of
the author, though added of course somewhat later than the date of
composition. The phrase ‘ adhuc vinens ’ or ‘dum vixit’ does not
seem to be any objection to this, It is used with a view to future
generations, and occurs also in the author’s account of his books
(p·360‚1·4)·

2. morosi: opposed here to ‘viciosi'3 cp. 1. 57 and Epistola (p. 1), l. 33.

7. soret, ‘ ought to be.'

19. Isaiah miii. 1. ¹

49. Cp. Traitoe‘, xv. 7, &c.

62. habet speciale, ‘ keeps as a secret!⁴

74. recoletur τ’ apparently meant for subjunctive.

QUICQUID HoMo semma, Ere. (p. 365)

Of the three forms given here we must suppose that of the Trentham
MS. to be the earliest. It is decidedly shorter than the others, it has
no prose heading, and it names the first year of Henry IV in such a
manner that we may probably assign it to that year. The poet’s
eyesight had then sailed to such an extent that it was difficult for him
any longer to write; but complete blindness probably had not yet
come on, and he does not yet use the word ‘cecus’ Of the other two
forms it is probable that that given by S is the later, if only because the
precise date is omitted and the very diffuse heading restrained within
reasonable limits. S, it is true, ends with this piece, while CHG have
the later pieces 3 but these were probably added as they were composed‚
