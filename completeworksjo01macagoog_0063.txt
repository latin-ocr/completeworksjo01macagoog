justice is disturbed chiefly by three things, gifts, favour, and sear.
Those who make friends with the judge will hardly lose their case.

CAP. V. Ο ye who sell justice for gain, learn what end awaits you.
The higher you rise, the greater will be your fan: the more wealth you
gather, the greater will be your misery. Ο thou judge who seekest after
wealth, why dost thou attend to all things else and neglect thyself i
Thou wilt gain the world, but lose heaven. An worldly power comes
to an end, and so, be sure, will thine-

CAP. v1. As regards the sheriffs, the bailiffs, and the jurymen at
assizes, they are ready to accept bribes and pervert justice. As the j
toad cursed the harrow, so 1 curse these many masters, who are all
unjust.

CAP. VII. Laws, nevertheless, there must be, to punish the nans·-
gressor3 and if there are laws there must also be judges. The worst
os evils is when justice is not to be had, and this causes a land to be
divided against itself. Much depends upon the ruler: for the sins of
a bad king the people are punished as well as the king himself. The
higher a man’s place is, the worse is the effect οἱ his evil-doing.
A law is nothing without people, or people without a king, or a king
without good counsel.

² C omplamts are everywhere heard now os the injustice of the high q
court, and the limbs suffer‘ because the head is diseased. The king* is Ι
an undisciplined youth, who neglects all good habits, and chooses
unworthy companions, by whose influence he is made worse. At the
same time older men give way to him for gain and pervert the justice ·
os the king’s court. N one can tell what the end will be: 1 can only l
mourn over these evils and offer my counsel to the youthful king. ¹

CAP. VIII. Every subject is bound to serve his king, and the king Ι
to govern his people justly. Hence 1 shall endeavour to set forth
a rule of conduct for the honour of my king.

F irst then, Ι say, govern thyself according to the law, and enforce
on thyself the precepts that are fitting for others. A king is above all
others ; he should endeavour to overcome and rise above himself. If
thou art above the lawS, live the more justly. Be gentle in thy acm,
for thy wrath is death. Endeavour to practise virtue in thy youth and
to avoid evil communications.

CAP. IX. Avoid false friends and those who stir up war for the sake
of their own profit. Resist those who will tempt thee to evil, Ο king.

 

¹ In the first version, ‘complaints are heard now of the injustice of the
high court: ssutterers have power over it, and those who speak the truth are
not permitted to come near to the king's side. The boy himself is blameloes,
but his councillors are in satilt. 15 the king were ot· mature age, he would
redress the balance of justice, but he is too young as yet to be held
responsible sor choice of advisers: it is not from the boy but froin his elders
that the evil springs which overruns the world!
