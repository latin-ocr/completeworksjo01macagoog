EDITIONS lxxvii

frequently used by our author like ‘ et‚’ standing at the beginning
of a clause or between the words which it combineS, as

⁶ Sic lecto vigilans meditabar plura, que mentem ’

Effudi,

ΟΥ ⁴ Cutte que Curre simul rapidi per deuia currunt,’

but it is also very often used in the correct classical manner. The
MSS. make no distinction between these two uses, but sometimes
join the conjunction to the preceding word and sometimes separate
it, apparently in a quite arbitrary manner. For the sake of clear-
ness the conjunction is separated in this edition regularly when
the sense requires that it should be taken independently of the

preceding ‘word, and the variations of the manuscripts with regard
to this are not recorded.

Again, some freedom has been used in the matter of capital
letter-S, which have been supplied, where they were wanting, in
the case of proper names and at the beginning os sentences.

The spelling is in every particular the same as that of the MS.
The practice of altering the medieval orthography, which is fairly
consistent and intelligible, so as to make it accord with classica]
or conventional usage, has little or nothing to be said for it, and
conceals the evidence which the forms of spelling might give with
regard to the prevalent pronunciation. ,

The principal differences in our text from the classieal orthography are as
follows:

e regularly sor the diphthongis ae, oe.

ι’ for e in perfunt, redum, nequab, &m (but also pereunt, δια).
