kept. Adam os Usk says that an income of 500 marks was granted to
him and his wife, but was never paid (p. 16).

217 f. It seems impossible to construe this, and 1 suspect that a line
has dropped out.

230. His sentence of death was commuted for that of exile to the
isle of Jersey (Rot. Parl. iii. 382).

231 f. So also below, l. 280, our author expresses a hope for the safe
return of the archbishop of Canterbury, who came back in company
with Hem-y of lancasten cp. 330 f.‚ where a hope is expressed for
future vengeance on the king. Yet we can hardly suppose that this
second part os the Chronicle was actually written before the events of
the third part had come to pasS. All that we can say is that the writer
gives to his narrative the semblance of having been composed as the
events happened. The return of Cobham is mentioned by him after-
wards (iii. 262).

233 ff. Our author reserves the ease of the archbishop to the last, as
a climax of the evil. He was actually sentenced on Sept. 25, before
the trial of the earl of Warwick (Rot. Parl. iii. 351). Sir John Cob-
ham‚ whose sentence is mentioned above, was not put on his trial till
Jan. 28, when parliament was sitting at Shrewsbury.

242. That is, the court of Rome was bribed to consent to his translation.

243. The title of his father, who was the second earl of Arundel,
was used by him as a surname. -

267 ff. This seems to mean that other private reasons were alleged
to the Pope.

280. See note on l. 231.

326f. An allusion to the campaign of 1380.

328 f. Referring especially to the very popular naval victory of
Arundel in 1387 (Walsingham, ii. 154).

340. That is, in the twenty-first γαπ of the reign (139'7).

17. This comparison of Richard’s proceedings to the work of a mole
under the ground (see also l. 12, margin) is appropriate enough as
a description of the plot which he undoubtedly laid against the
liberties of the kingdom, but the comparison is perhaps chiefly
intended to suggest that Richard, and not Henry, was the ‘ talpa ore dei
maledicta ’ of prophecy (Glendower’s ‘ mould-warp ⁹), cp. Archaeologz‘a,
xx. p. 258.

27 ff. This refers to the appointment of a committee with full powers
to deal with the petitions and other matters left unfinished in this
parliament. The committee consisted os twelve lords, os whom six
should be a quorum, and six commons‚ three to be a quorum: see Rot.
