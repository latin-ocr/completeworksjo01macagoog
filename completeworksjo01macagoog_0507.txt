church of St. Gregory at Poitiers. It was said to have been brought
to England by Henry, first duke of Lancaster, and to have been de·
livered by him to the Black· Prince. Thus it came into the possession
os Richard 11, who is said to have worn it constantly about his neck.
He had desired to be re·anointed with this oil, but archbishop
Arundel had refused to perform the ceremony (Annales Henn'ci IV,
pp. 297-300‚ Eulog. His-n contin. iii. 380).

o REcoLENDE, Ere. (p. 345)

The first eight lines of this appear in the Trentham MS. in combina-
tion with ‘ H. aquile pullus ’ as part of the dedication of the Cinkante
Βῗῐδαιίξεὲ or ‘ pietas,' ‘ piuS,’ see note on Cronica Ὶὴὶύενίίέα, iii. 462.

‘ Putruerunt et corrupte sunt,’ διο. This is in fact a quotation from
the PsaImS‚ ‘ Putruerunt et corruptae sunt cicatrices meae a facie
insipientiae meae‚’ xxxvii. 6. (xxxviii. 5).

32. quasi Iout’m'ani. Already in the Vox clamantis we have had
reference to the ‘new Jovinian' who is a sower of heresy (vi. 1267),
and the person meant is no doubt Wycliffe. Jovinian, the opponent of
Jerome on the marriage question, is taken as a type of the ecclesiastic
of lax principles Milman calls Jovinian and vigilantius ‘ premature
Protestants ’ (fflstmy quhristianiafy, Bk. 111. ch. iv).

36. sub grossa lana= an allusion perhaps to the simple russet garb of
Wycliffe's poor priests..

52 ff. Cp. Vox Clamantis, ii. 437 ff„ whence many of these lines are
taken, eg· 54-57, 60-77·

54. mortis ymago z that is, the mortal creature.

86. ‘time’ was probably written originally for‘stude' in SCH, as
well as in F, but it was perceived perhaps that ‘ reuereri,’ which was
required for the rhyme, would not stand as an imperative. Similarly
in line 88 ‘ Que fantasias aliter tibi dant' stood no doubt originally in
SCH, and was altered for grammatical reasons,

181 f. This couplet is repeated from Vox Clamanttk, vi. 861 f.

190. quam prius, for ‘ prius quam‚’ as frequently: cp. 11. 202, 292.

199. This line is from Ovid, Metam. vii. 826, ‘ Credula res amor est,'
&c., and is quite without sense as it stands here : cp. Vox Clamantis,
v. 165.

,203 f. 1 Cor. vi. 18.
246 ff. Cp. Vox Clamantis, vi. 445 ff.
250. semel mlvi, i. e. ‘once only· for ‘non nisi semel ’ z cp. Vox

Clamantzze, iii. 22.
