lxx GOWER’S LATIN WORKS

Ha. HATFOELD HALL, in the possession of the Marquess of Salisbury,
by whose kind permission 1 was allowed to examine it. Contains the
Vox C lamauttlr, preceded by the Table of Chapters. Parchment‚ ff. 144
(not counting blanks), about 9} x 6stin„ in eighteen quires of eight
with oetchword33 neatly written in a hand of the first half of the fif-
teenth century, 40 lines to the page. There is a richly illuminated
border round three sides of the page where the Prologue of the
Vox clamantis begins, and also on the next, at the beginning of the
first book, and floreated decorations at the beginning of each
succeeding book, with illuminated capitals throughout. The catch-
words are sometimes ornamented with neat drawings.

The book has a certain additional interest derived from the fact that
it belonged to the celebrated Lord Burleigh, and was evidently read by
him with some interest, as is indioeted by various notes..

This MS„ of which the text is fairly correct, is written in one hand
throughout, and with T it represents, so far as we can judge, the original
form os the text in all the revised passagee. In some few cases, as iv. 1073,
v. 450, Hs seems to give the original reading, where T agrees with the re·
vised MSS.

On the last leaf we find an interesting note about the decoration of the
book and the parchment used, written small in red below the ‘Explicin’ which
1 read aa follows ε · roo and li. ⁵¹ blew letteris, 4 co. smale letteris and more,

are those at the beginning of the first prologue and the seven books·
