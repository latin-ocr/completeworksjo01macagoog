408 CRONICA TRIPERTITA

158 f. Though he was a knight, he was not dignified with the noble·-
fonn of execution, being a citizen of London.

162. Cornubienszk: Sir Robert Tresilian, Chief Justice.

172. falsa stjgilla: that is, the seals set by the judgoe to the questions
and replies submitted to them at N ottingham. ‘In quorum omnium
testimonium Iustieiarii et Serviens predicti sigilla sua presentibus
apposuerunt' (Rot. Parl. iii. 2333 cp. Knighton, ii. 237). They all
pleaded that they had set their seals to these replies under the influence
of threats from the archbishop of York, the duke os Ireland, and the
earl of Suffolk.

173. magis ansam, ‘ or rather a handle ’ (i.e. a pretext). The reading
of the MSS. is doubtful (S apparently ‘ausam‚’ but with a stop aster
‘ regi '). The form of expression is not unusual with our author.

174 f. ⁸ There was no punishment which would have been sufficient,'&c.

176. ficta pietate: that is, what our author in the Consi Ammatth- calls
⁴ pite seigned,' i. e. salse or misplaced clemency.

176ff. Knighton says that the queen interceded for them with the
prelates (ii. 295). For the intervention ot the prelates see Rot. Part.
ui. 241.

1781. For the terms of their exile see Rot. Parl. iii. 244, Knighton‚
ii. 2955.

183. The sense of the preceding negative seems to be extended to
this line also.

188 ff. 1 do not know of any other authority for this expulsion of
srlgae· cantusz apparently genitive in spite of the metre3 so ‘ducatus,'
iii. 117, ‘excercitus,’ ‘luxus‚’ Vox clamantis, i. 609, vi. 1224.

215. hirundo: a reference to the name Arundel.

SECUNDA PARS

There is an interval of nearly ten years between the first and the
second part of the Chronicle. Our author proceeds to the events of
1397. He assumes that the king carried out a long-meditated plan of
vengeance‚ cp. 11. 23 ff„ but this was of course an after-thought by way
of accounting for what happened.

15. A pardon was granted to all three in the Parliament of 1387—88,
‘par estatut’ (see Rot. Parl. iii. 350), and a special charter of pardon
was granted to the earl of Arundel at Windsor, April 30, 1 394 (Rot. Parl.
iii. 35 1 ; cp. Α nn. Ric. II, p. 21 1). See below, ll. 2 59 s„ where the charters
of pardon are said to have been procured by archbishop Arundel who
was then Chancellor. It seems to be implied that the other two had
similar chastes-S, but nothing is said of this in the Rolls of Parliament;
cp. Eulog. Hist. iii. 374.

56. Cp. Ann. Ric. II, p. 202 (Rolls Series, 28. 3) ‘iurans suo solito

iuramento, per sanctum Iohannem Baptistam, quod nihil mali pateretur
in corpore, si se pacifice reddere voluisset:
