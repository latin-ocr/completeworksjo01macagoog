425 ff. Cp. Aurora, (MS. Bodley 822) f. 103,

‘ Cogitat inde domum domino fundare, sed audit

- A domino, “ Templi non fabricator eris.

Es uir sanguineuS, ideo templum mihi dignum

Non fabricare potes, filius immo tuus.”

Sanguineas uir signat eum qui, crimina carnis

Amplectens, templum non ualet esse dei.

Ecclesie sancte talis non· exigit edem,

Nec sacre fidei collocat ille domum?

508. ‘And whosoever may sound trumpets, we ought to be silent’ :
cp. i. 1609.

531 f. Aurora, f. 75 v0.

6191. Ovid, Pont. ii. 5. 61 f.

623 f. Pont. ii. 6. 21 f.

641. See Ars Amat. ii. 417, where we find ‘ semine,’ a reading
which is required by the sense, but not given in the Gower MSS.

651. ‘ The line of descent by right of his mother proclaims Christ to
be heir of that land in which he was born.’ The author argues sor
crusades to recover the Holy Laud, if there must be wars, instead of
wars against fellow christiana, waged by one pope against the other
under the name of crusades: cp. below, 945 ff.

676. quosoret :pse vigil, ⁶ where it ought to be watchful,’ a common
use of the imperfect subjunctive in our author’s Latin: cp. ‘gestaret,'
695, ‘ lederet‚’ 922, ‘ medicaret‚’ 105²·

815. What follows is spoken as in the person of the supreme pontiff z
cp. Mirour, 18505—18792‚ where somewhat similar avowals are put into
the mouth of a member of the Roman Court.

819 f. Cp. Cous. Amantis‚ Prol. 261,
‘ The hevene is ferr, the world is nyh.’

835. ovid, Fasti, v. 209.

955 f. 1 take this concluding couplet· as a remark made by the author
on the sentimenta which he has just heard expressed by the represen-
tative of the Pope. It practically means that ‘ Clemens ' is not a proper
name for the Pope: it is in fact a ‘ headless name ' and should rather
be ‘ InclemenS.’ Compare the address to Innocent 111 at the begin-
ning of Geoffrey de Vinsauf’s Poetria Nova:

‘Papa‚ stupor mundi, si dixero Papa nocenti,
Acephalum nomen tribuam tibi: si caput addam,
Hostis erit metri,’ «Sec.

957 ff. It seems best to take what follows as, in part at least,
a dialogue between the author and the representative of the pope, who
has just spoken. Soon however the speech passes again entirely to
the author. The Biblieal reference here is to Revelation, xxii. 8 f.
The same use is made of it in the Mirour, 18736ff.

1077-1080. These four lines are from the Aurora, f. 44 v⁰.
