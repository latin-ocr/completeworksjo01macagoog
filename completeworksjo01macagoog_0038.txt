. xxvi INTRODUCTION

To the information which we derive from records must be
adde‘d that which is to be drawn from the poet’s own writings.
From the Speculum M'editanttk we learn that in early life he com·
posed love poems, which he calls ⁸ fols ditz d’ amour ’ (2 7 340),
and from two other passages (11. 8794 and 17649) we may
perhaps assume that he was already married at the time when this
work was composed. In the former, speaking of those who tell
tales to husbands about their wives’ misconduct, he says in effect,
‘ 1 for my part declare (‘ Je di pour moi ') that 1 wish to hear no
such tales of my wife :' in the second he speaks of those wives who
dislike servants and other persons simply because their husbands
like them, and he adds, ‘ 1 do not say that mine does so ’ (‘ Ne di
pas q' ensi fait la moie’). If the inference be correct, his union
with Agnes Groundolf in his old age was a second marriage. We
cannot come to any definite conclusion from this poem about any
profession or occupatiori which he may have had besides literature.
The statement of Leland that he practised as a lawyer seems
rather improbable, in view of the way in which he here speaks of
lawyers and their profession. of all the secular estates that of
the law seems to him to be the worst (2408 5 fit), and he condemns
both advocates and judges in a more uirqualiiied manner than the
members of any other calling. Especially the suggestion of a
special tax to be levied on lawyers' gains (24337 ff.) is one that
could hardly have come from one who was himself a lawyer ¹.

Again the way in which he speaks of physicians (24301,
2 562 1 ff.) seems almost equally to exclude him from the profession
of medicine.

Of all the various ranks of society which he reviews‚ that of
which he speaks with most respect is the estate of Merchants.

¹ At the same time 1 2111 disposed to attach some weight to the expression

111 Mr'r. 21774, where the author says that some may blame him for handling
sacred subiecta, because he is no ⁴ clerk‚'

‘Aina ai vestu la raye manche.

This ma ay possibly 1110211 only to indicate 1110 dress of 2 1291111111, but on the
other hand it s'eems clear that some lawyers, perhaps especially the
‘apprenticii ad leg-em: were distin nguished by stripes upon their sleeves, see
for example the epainti1 ig reproduce din Pulli mg s Order roseln Cous (ed 1897)-
and sedeants—atdaw are referred to in Pr'ers Plowman, A text, Pass. iii. 277, as

. wearing 2 ‘ ray robe with rich pelure.’ we must admit, therefore, the

poisaibilxy that Gower was 111·οᾱ 10 1110 law, though he may not have practised
it or 2 'ving.
