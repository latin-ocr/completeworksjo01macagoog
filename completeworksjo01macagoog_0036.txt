nave and aisles, which were finally removed in 1833, were of the
time of Richard 11 and Henry IV ¹. It is certain, however, that
the church remained long in an unfinished state during the period
between 1207 (or 1212), the date of the early fire, and the latter
part of the fourteenth century. Dollman observes that the
remains which may have been contained in the tomb ⁸ dis-
appeared when the tomb was removed from the north aisle in
18323 ¹ From what has been said it will be perceived that the
tomb has undergone a series of alterations and renovations which
have to some extent at least destroyed its original character.

A word must be said finally about Prof. Morley’s theory that
Gower was in holy orders and held the living of Great Braxted
in Essex from 1390-7. This is founded on the fact that the
parson of Great Braxted for the period named was one John
Gower, as Professor Morley learns from N ewcourt’s Reperton'um
Parochr'ale ³. The original record referred to by N ewcourt is to be
found in the Registry of the diocese of London ⁴, and is to the
effect that on February 2 3, 1390-1, the bishop of London
admitted and instituted John Gower‚ clerk, to the parochial church
of Great Braksted, vacant by the resignation of John Brenn,
the late rector, the said John Gower having been duly presented
by the king, who at this time was patron of the living, the heir os
the late earl of Pembroke being under his wardship. Then later,
under date March 31, 1397, there is record of a new institution to
the benefice, which is vacant by the resignation of John Gower,
late rector ⁸.

Professor Morley thought that the expression ‘ John Gower,
clerk ' might indicate that the person referred to was in minor orders
only, some of the rectors inducted being called ‘ priest ’ (while
others have no title at all). He conceived that this John Gower
held the rectory for six or seven years without being admitted to
-priest's orders at all, and that he then resigned on his marriage ⁶,

a bone, which he said was taken from the tomb in 1832. 1 tried to have this
buried in the tornb on the occasion of the last removal, but 1 was told it had
disappeared.’

Braxted is nearly a year earlier than the marriage os Gower the poet.
