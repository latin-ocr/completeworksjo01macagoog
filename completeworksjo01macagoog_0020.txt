viii IN TRODUCTION

6 Ric. II on a matter which had been already mentioned by
N icolas on the authority of Mr. Petrie. As the result of a further
examination of the Close Rolls and other records Ι am able to
place some of the transactions referred to in a clearer light, while
at the same time I find myself obliged to cast serious doubt on
the theory that all the documents in question relate to the poet.
In short, the conclusions at which 1 arrive, so far as regards the
recordS, are mostly of a negative character.

It may be taken as proved that the family to which John Gower
the poet belonged was of Kent. Caxton indeed says of him that
he was born in Wales, but this remark was probably suggested by
the name of the ‘ land of Gower ’ in Wales, and is as ‘little to be
trusted as the further statement that his birth was in the reign 'of
Richard II. There was a natural tendency in the sixteenth century
to connect him with the well-known Gowers of Stitenham in
Yorkshire‚ whence the present noble family of Gower derives its

 

origin, and Leland says definitely that the poet was of Stitenhamk ’ ’

It is probable, however, that Leland had no very certain informa·-
tion3 for when we examine his autograph manuscript, we find
that he first wrote, following Caxton, ‘ ex cambria, ut ego accepi,
originem duxit,’ and afterwards altered this to ‘ ex Stitenhamo,
villa Eboracensis prouinciae, originem ducens.’ It is probable

that the credit of connexion with the poet had been claimed by -

the Yorkshire family, whose ‘ proud tradition,' as Todd says, ‘ has
been and still is that he was of Stitenham,' and we find reason, to
think that they had identified him with a certain distinguished
lawyer of their house. This family tradition appears in Leland’s
Itineran‘um, vi. 13, ‘ The house of Gower the poete sumtyme
chief iuge of the commune place’ (i. e. Common Pleas) ‘yet
remaineth at Stitenham yn Yorkshire‚ and diuerse of them syns
have been knights? He adds that there are Gowers also in
Richrnondshire and Worcestershire (‘ Wicestreshire,' MS.). The
statement that this supposed judge was identical with the poet
is afterwards withdrawn3 for on a later page Leland inserts
a note, ‘ Mr. Ferrares told me that Gower the iuge could not
be the man that write the booke yn Englisch, for he said that
Gower the iuge was about Edward the secundes tyme.’ ¹

² Irin. vi. 55. From Foss, Tabulae Canales, it would seem that there was
no iudge named Gower in the r4th century. .
