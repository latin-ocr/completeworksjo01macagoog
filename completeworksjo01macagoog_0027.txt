LIFE OF GOWER xv

irregularly acquired ·in 1365, and possibly with this may be
connected a payment by John Gower of A 20 at Michaelmas
in the year 1368 to Richard de Ravensere ¹, who seems to have
been keeper of the hanaper in Chancery.

It is impossible without further proof to assume that the
villainous misleader of youth who is described to us in the report
of the above commission, as encouraging a young man to defraud
the Crown by means of pet-jury, in order that he may purchase
his lands from him at a nominal price, can be identical with the
grave moralist of the Speculum Hominis· and the Vox clamantis.
Gower humbly confoeses that he has been a great sinuer, but he
does not spaek in the tone of a converted libertine: we cannot
reconcile our idea of him with the proceedings of the disreputable
chmcter who for his own ends encouraged the young William
Septvans in his dishonesty and exnavagance. The two men
apparently bore the same armS, and therefore they belonged to
the same family, but beyond this we cannot go. It may be
observed moreover that the picture suggested to Prof. Morley
by the deed of 1373, executed at Otsord, of the poet’s residence
in the pleasant valley of the Darent, which he describes at some
length-¹, m'ust in any case be dismissed as baseless. Otford was
a maner held by Sir John Cobharn ⁸, and whether the John
Gower of this deed be the poet or no, it is pretty clear that the
deod in question was executed there principally for this reason,
and not beoeuse it was the residence of John Gower.

Dismissing all the above records as of doubtful relevancy to
our subject ⁴, we proceed to take note of some which seem actually
to refer to the poet. Of these none are earlier than the reign
of Richard 11. They are as follows:

1 Ric. 11. (May, 1378). A record that Geoffrey Chaucer has
given general power of attorney to John Gower and Richard

¹ Καὶ. claues. 42 Ed. 111. m. ¹3 d.

² English Writers, vol. iv. pp. 150 ff.

⁸ See Calendar os Post Mortem Inquisits‘ons, vol. ii. pp. 300, 302.

⁴ Soalso the deeds of 1 Ric. 11 releasing lande to Sir J. Frebody and John
Gower (Hasted's History quent, iii. 425), and of 4 Ric. 11 ln which isabella
daughter of Walter de Huntyngfeld gives up to John Gower and John Βουν-
land all her rights in the parishes of Throwley and Stalesfleld, Kent (Rot.
ems. 4 Ric. 11. m. 15 d), and again another in which the same lady remits to
John Gower all actions, planus, erc„ which may have misen between them
(Rot. Clau-5. 8 Ric. 11. m. 5 d).
