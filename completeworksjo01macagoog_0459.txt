EPISTOLA.

THIS Epistle‚ written apparently on the occasion of sending a copy
of the book to the archbishop, is found only in the All Souls MS„ and
it is reasonable to suppose that this was the copy in question. The
statement of Mr. Coxe in the Roxburghe edition, that ‘the preface to
archbishop Arundel . . . is also in the original hand' of the book,
(Introduction, p. lix) is a surprising one, and must have been due to
some deception of memory. The hand here is quite a different on'e
from that of the text which followS, and has a distinctly later character.
The piece is full of erasureS, which are indicated in this edition by
spaced type, but the corrections are in the same hand as the rest.·
Having no other copy of it, we cannot tell what the original form of the
erased passages may have been, but it is noticeable that the most
important of them (ll. 26—34) has reference almost entirely to the
blindness of the author, and nearly every one contains something
which may be regarded as alluding to this, either some mention
of light and darkness, or some allusion to the fact that his only
perceptions now are those of the mind. We may perhaps conclude
that the Epistle was inscribed here before the author quite lost his
eyesight, and that the book then remained by him for some time
before it was presented. The illuminated capital S with which this
composition begins is combined with a miniature. painting of the
archbishop.

2. tibi scribe, ‘ 1 dedicate to thee.’

3. Quod . . . scribtum: written over erasure3 perhaps originally
‘ Quem . . . librum‚’ altered to avoid the repetition of ‘librum ² from the
preceding line.

4. contempletur: apparently in a passive impersonal sense.

17. Ce'cus ego mere. The word ‘ mere’ alone is over erasure here.
but if we suppose that the original word was ‘ fere,’ we may regard this
>as referring originally to a gradual sailure of the eyesight, not to
complete blindness. ⁹

19. Corpore defectus, ‘the sailure in my body‚’ as subject of ‘ sinit.'

23. dumque: equivalent to ‘ dum’ in our author's language3 cp.
i. 165, 2007, &c.

33. morosa: this word has a good meaning in Gower’s language‘3
cp. ‘ Ο deus immense,’ Ι. 2, where ‘morosi’ is opposed to ‘ viciosi)
