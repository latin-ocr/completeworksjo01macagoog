420 LAST porus, NOTES

and the An Souls book may have been presented to archbishop
Arundel before the last poems were written.

This concluding pieee is written in S in the same hand as the
Epistola at the beginning of the book, the heading apparently over
the writing of another hand, some parts as {diciturss l. 2, ‘tripertita-
tempore,⁹ 2, 3, being obviously over erasure. The original hand
remains for ‘est qualiter ab illa Cronica que‚’ ‘in Anglia—rerum,'
‘ varia carmina—quia!

1 have no doubt that this exhortation was set down by Gower
himself, who had probably arranged before his death for the promised
indulgence, following the principle laid down in the last poem of the
collection, of being his own executor in such matters. The verses
⁴ Armigeri scutum,’ δια, which are appended in the Glasgow MS. were
originally upon his tomb, and they have every appearance of being his
own composition: cp. p. 352, ll. 217 ff. Berthelette after describiug
the tomb says, ‘And there by hongeth a table, wherin appereth that
who so cuer praith for the soule of John Gower, he shall, so ost as he
so dothe‚ haue a thousande and fyue hundred dayes of pardon.'

PRESUL, omn: REG1s, Ere. (p. 368)

This is evidentlyaddressed to archbishop Arundel. The comet referred
to is no doubt that of March, 1402. The evils complained of are the
conspiracies against the king, and we are told by the chroniclers that
the appearance of this comet in the north was taken as a presage of the
troubles in Wales and in Northumberlandt cp. Walsingham‚ ii. 248.
Adam of Usk, who saw it when on the Continent, says it was visible by
day as well as by night, and that it probably prefigured the death of
the duke of Milan, whose arms were also seen in the sky (p. 73).

5. The neglect complained of is of prayers for the soul of the departed.
Gower seems to have followed his own precept and made arrangements
for some of the prayers in his lifetirne, though others are provided for
by his will. Berthelette in his preface to the Confessio A mantis (15 32)
speaks of Gower’s place of burial as having been prepared by himself in
the church of St. Mary OvereS, ‘ where he hath of his owne foundation
a masse dayly songe. And more ouer he hath an obyte yerely done
for hym within the same churche, on fryday aster the feaste of the
blessed pope saynte Gregory.’ St. Gregory’s day is March 12.
