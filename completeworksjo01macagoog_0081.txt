The second os the parchment blanks at the beginning has a note in the
original hand of the MS. on the marriage of the devil and· the birth of his
² nine daughters, who were assigned to various classes of human society,
Simony to the prelates, Hypocrisy to the religious orders, and so on. At
the end of the book there are two leaves with theologica! and other notes in
the nme hand, and two cut for put-posen os binding from leaves of an older
HS. os Latin hymns, ἀο. with music.

La. meom CATnmRAL LmRARv, A. 72, very obligingly placed
at my disposal in the Bodleian by the Librarian, with authority from the
Dean and Chapter. contains the same as L, including the enigmatical
lines above quoted. Paper, ff. 184, measuring about 8 x 6 in. neatly
written in an early sixteenthaeentury hand, about 26 lines to tbe page.
No coloured initials, but space lest for them'and on f. 21 sor a picture
corresponding to that on f. 21 of the Laud MS. N either books nor -
chapters numbered. Marked in pencil as ‘one of Dean Honywood's,
No. 533

Certainly copied from L, giving a precisely similar form of text and
agreeing almost always in the minutest details. ·

Τ. Tarm-rr Comma, Duum, D. 4, 6, kindly sent to the Bodleian
sor my use by the Librarian, with the authority of the Provost and
Fellows. Contains Vox clamantis· without Table of Chapters,
followed by the account os the author’s books», ⁶ Quia ynusquisque,’ &c.
Parchment, ff. 144 (two blank) in seventeen quires, usually of eight
leaves, but the first and, sixteenth ot* ten and the last of twelve3 written
in an early naemu-century hand, 36—39 lines to the page, no passages
erased or rewritten. Coloured initiale.

This, in agreement with the Hatfleld book (Ha), gives the original form
os all the passages which were revised or rewritten. It is apparently
a eareless ,copy of a good text, with many mistakoe, some of which are
corrected. The scribe either did not understand what he was writing
or did not attend to the meaning, and a good many lines and couplets
have been carelessly dropped out, as i. 873,136o,1749, 1800, ii. Ptol. 24 s..
