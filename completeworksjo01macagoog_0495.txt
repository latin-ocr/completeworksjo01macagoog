sound feels no hurt. Thus, if the reader is not guilty of the faults spoken
of, he will pass untouched by the reproo'f.

1470. ⁶ Vox populi, vox dei ’ ε a sentiment repeated by our author in
various forms 3 cp. note on iii. Prol. 11.

147 9 ff. These last three lines are over erasure in SCHG. They seem
to have been substituted for the original couplet in order to point more
clearly the moral- of the Cronica ijbertita, which is intended for a
practical illustration of the divine punishment of sin.

Explicit, ἃς. It will be seen that in these later years Gower has
almost brought himself to believe that the events of the earlier part of
the reign were intended for a special warning to the youthful king,
whom he conceives as having then already begun a course of tyrannical
government. At the time, however, our author acquitted him of all
responsibility‚ on account of his youth.

11 ff. The swan was used as a badge by the duke of Gloucester and-
also (perhaps not till after his death) by Henry of Lancaster. For the

horse and the bear as cognitances of Arundel and Warwick see Annales
Ricardi II (Rolls Series, 28. 3), p. 206.

CRONICA TRIPERTITA

1. Ista tnjbedita, διο. These sevenlines must beregarded asametrical
preface to the Chronicle which follows. In the Hatton MS. these lines.
with their marginal note are placed before the prose of the preceding
page (which is given in a somewhat different form) and entitled
⁴ Prologus!

Fama PARS

1. Take the first letter of ‘ mundus’ and add to it C three times
repeated and six periods of five year-5, plus ten times five and seven.
The date thus indicated is MCCC 4- 30 4- 57, i. e. 1387. For a similar
mode of expression cp. Richard of Maidstone’s poem on the Reconcilia-
τίθη os Rt'cltard II (Rolls SerieS, 14. 1),

⁶ M. cape, ter quoque C. deciesque novem, duo iunge!

4-12. These lines are written over an erasure in SC HG. The
original version of them is not extant, so far as 1 am aware.

51. penna coronata. This, as the margin tells us, is the Earl Marshall,
that is Thomas Mowbray‚ earl of N ottingham, afterwards duke of
Νέἷοιέκί gm‘t S ε the earl of Derby‚ from whose badge os S, stand-
ing probably sor ‘ Soverein,’ came the device of the well-known collar
os SS. His tomb has the word ‘ Soverayne ⁹ repeated several times on
thgfimczgffiionica luna, ‘ the northern moon: that is, the earl of Ν orth-
umberland. The variation of the text in the Harleian MS„ written

over an erasure, arises no doubt from the later disagreement between
Henry IV and-Northumberland.
