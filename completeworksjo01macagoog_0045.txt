VOX CLAMANTIS xxxiii

so that in many places the composition is entirely made up of such
borrowed matter variously arranged and combined. This is
evidently a thing to be noted, because if the author, when de·
scribing (for example) the vices of monasteries, is found to be
merely quoting from Alexander Neckam‚ we cannot attach much
value to his account as a picture of the manners of his own time.
His knowledge of Ovid seems to have been pretty complete, for he
borrows from almost every section of his works with the air of one
who knows perfectly well where to turn sor what he wants3 quite
a large portion of Neckam’s poem is appropriated without the

smallest acknowledgement, and many long passages are taken from “

the Aurora, with only one slight mention os this source (iii. 18 53).
Most os the good Latin lines for which Gower has got credit with
critics are plagiarisms of this kind, and if Professor Morley had
realized to what extent the Vox clamantis is a compilation, he
would hardly have estimated the work so highly as he has done.
The extracts from medieval authors are to some extent tolerable,
because they are usually given in a connected and intelligible
shape, but the perpetual borrowing of isolated lines or couplets
from Ovid, often without regard to their appropriateness or their
original meaning, often makes the style, ot' the first book especially,
nearly as bad as it can be. 1 have taken the pains to point out
a considerable number of plagiarismS, but it is certain that there
must be many instances which have esca-ped my notice. In his
η later Latin verse the author is very much less dependent upon
others, and the Crom‘ca Tnpertita‚ from the nature of the subject,
is necessarily original.

Gower's own style of versification in Latin is somewhat less ele-
gant than that of Alexander Neckam or Peter Riga, but it stands
upon much the same level of correctness. 1f we take into account
the fact that the Latin is not classical but medieval, and that certain
licences os prosody were regularly admitted by medieval writers of
Latin verse, we shall· not find the persormance very bad. Such
licences are, sor example, the lengthening of a short syllable at the
caesura, the position of final short vowels before ‘ st,’ ‘sp,' ⁶ sc ’ at
the beginning of the succeeding word, and the use of polysyllabic
words, or of two dissyllableS, at the end of the hexameter, so that
lines such as these are not to be taken as irregular:

‘Omnis et inde gradus a presule sanctificatus3’

‘Quo minor est culpa, si cadat inde ren ς’
