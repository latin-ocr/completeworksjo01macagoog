seen in some Gower MS. a selection of sententious passages from ”

the Vox Clamanttk and other places, such as we actually have on
one of the blank leaves of the Digby MS. (s. 160), beginning
‘ Vulturis est hominum natura cadauera velle,' again one of those
allegories of bird nature which were borrowed by Gower from the
Aurora. '

It may be noted here that in the same passage of Bale’s un-
published papers we have the following statement:

‘ De triplici opere hoc carmen est super eius tumbam editum,
Quos viuens legi libros nunc offero regi,

‘ Quam bonitas, pietaS, elemosina, casta voluntas,
Sobrietas que fides coluerunt, hic iacet Agnes.
