 

LIFE OF GOWER ix

All this seemsto suggest that Leland had no very trustworthy
evidence ‘on the matter. He continued to assert, however, as we
have seen, that the poet derived his origin from Stitenham, and
to this he adds that he was brought up and practised as a lawyer,
‘ Coluit sorum et patrias leges lucri causa ¹.' It has not been
noticed that the author’s manuscript has here in the margin what
is probably a reference to authority for this statement: we find
there a note in a contemporary hand, ‘ Goverus seruiens ad legem
30 Ed. 3! From this it is probable that Leland is relying on the
Your-book of 30 Ed. 111, where we find the name Gower, apparently
as that of a serieant-at·law who took· part in the proceedings. It
is not likely that Leland had any good reasons for identifying this
Go'wer, who was in a fairly high position at the bar in the year
1356, with John Gower the poet, who died in 1408 ⁸.

Leland's statements were copied by Bale and so became public
property. They did not, however, long pass unchallenged.
Thynne in his Animadversions acutely criticises the suggestion of
Yorkshire origin, on the ground of the difference of arms :-‘ Bale
bath much mistaken it, as he hath done infinite things in that book,
being for the most part the collections of Leland. For in truth
the arms of· Sir John Gower being argent, on a cheveron azure
three leopards’ heads or, do prove that he came os a contrary house

’ to the Gowers of Stytenham in Yorkshire, who bare barruly of

argent and galea, a (τι-σεε paty flory sable. Which difference of
arms seemeth a difference of familieS, unless you can prove that
being of one family they altered their arms upon some just occa-
sion! The arms to which Thynne refers as those of Gower the
poet are those which are to be seen upon his tomb ⁸3 and the
argument is undoubtedly sound. Thynne proceeds to criticise

Speght’s statement that Chaucer and Gowcr were both lawyers of ν ⁸

the Inner Temple: ‘You say, It seemeth that these learned men
were of the Inner Temple, for that many years since Master Buck·
ley did see a record in the same house, where Geffrey Chaucer

¹ Smpt. Brit. i. 414. This statement also appears aa a later addition in the
manuscript. ’

¹ ⁴ Gower ⁹ appears in Tottil’s publication of the Year-books (1585) both
in ⁹9 and 30 Ed. 111, e.g. ⁹9 Ed. 111, Enter- term, ff. πο, 27, 33, 46, and
30 Ed. 111, michaelium term, ff. 16, ὥρα νο. He appears usuallyas counsel,
but on some occasions he speaks apparently aa a judge. The Year-books
of the succeeding years, 31-36 lea-111, have not been published.

⁸ These arms appear also in the Glasgow 115.ss the Vox clamantes.
