65. The earl of Oxsord, lately created duke of Ireland, whose badge
was a boar's head, was Chies Justice of Chester in this year, and there
r'aised forces for the king, with the assistance of Thomas Molyneuxe
Constable of chester, ⁸ cuius nutum tota illa provincia expectabat,'
Walsingham, ii. p. 167 (Rolls Series, 28. 2).

80. Tem-t see note on Vox clamantis, vii. 1067: a pane means
apparently ‘ on one side,' or perhaps ‘on the side of the victors.’

The place where this affair happened is not very well described by
the authoritieS, but it seems clear that the first attempt of the earl of
Oxsord (or duke os Ireland) to cross the river was made at Radcot
(Knighton, Rolls Series, ii. 253). Here he found the bridge partly
broken, so that one horseman only could cross it at a time, and guarded
by men-at·arms and archers set there by the earl of Derby. At the same
time he was threatened with attack by the earl of Derby himself on the
one side and the duke of Glbucester on the other, both apparently on
the northern bank of the river. Walsingham says that he went on to
another bridge, and, finding this also guarded, plunged in on horseback
and escaped by swimming over the river. Knighton gives us to under·
stand that he was prevented by the appearance of the duke of Glou·
cester’s force from making his way along the northern bank, and at
once plunged in and swam the stream, ‘et sic mirabili ausu evasit ab
eis? Walsingham adds that he was not pursued, because darkness had
come on (it was nearly the shortest day of the year) and they did not
know the country. This chronicler does not mention Radcot Bridge, but
refers to the place vaguely as ‘iuxta Burford, prope Babbelake.’ It is
impossible, however, that either the fight, such as it was, or the escape
os the earl of Oxford can have taken place at Bablock Hythe. No doubt
the lords returned to Oxford after the affair bythis serry, which was prob-
ably the shortest way. The earl of Oxsord seems to have made his way
to London, and after an interview with the king to have embarked at
Queenborough for the Continent (Malverne, in Roils Series, 41. 9,
p. 112). .

89ff. Τῇε marginal note speaks of the ‘castra que ipse [Comes Oxonie]
familie sue pro signo gestanda attribuerat.⁹ The cognizance referred, no
doubt, to the city of Chester. The same note tells us that the duke of
Gloucester bore a fox-tail on his spear as an ensign: cp. Harding’s
chronicle, p. 341 ε

‘ The foxe taile he bare ay on his spere,
Where so he rode in peace or elles in warte!
