gains. Let none admit these to his house, who desires to keep his
wife chaste, any more than he would admit pigeons to his bed-chamber,
if he wished to keep it clean.

CAP. XXI. These infect the laity by their bad mmple. The bishop
ought not to ordain such men: and he who might prevent an evil and
does not, is equally guilty with him who causes it.

CAP. XXI 1. The clergy deny the right of laymen to judge and punish
them, yet the sins of the clergy deeply affect the laity. We are all
brethren in Christ and we are bidden to rebuke our brethren, is they
do wrong, and to cast them out os the Church, if they will not amend.

CAP. XXIII. Priests say that in committing fornication they do
not sin more than other men who are guilty of this vice. But their
sacred condition and their vow of chastity makes the evil worse in
them than in a cobbler or a shepherd.

CAP. XXIV. 11· we consider the office of the priesthood, we shall
find that the vestments and ornaments of priests are all symbolical of ⁸
the virtues which they ought to possess.

CAP. XXV. The ceremonies of sacrifices under the old law were
symbols of the virtues required in priests under the new, and as
under the old dispensation the ministers os the altar ought to be with·
out defect and deformity of body, so the priests of the new law should
be spiritually free from blemish. Uzzah touched the ark with unclean
hands and was punished with death: so he who comes polluted to the
service of the altar is worthy of punishment.

Cu. XXVI. A man must be of mature age before he assumes the
priesthood3 sor youth is apt to yield to the temptations of the flesh.
The evil impulses cannot be wholly expelled, but they may be kept in
check. as is symbolized by the tonsure of the priest. Let the priest
avoid idleness, whence so many vices spring.

CAP. XXVII. The honour of priests is great, if they live worthily.
They administer to us the sacraments during our lives, they give us
buria] when we are dead, they are the sa1t of the earth and the light 0 V
of the world. So much the worse is it when they are ignorant and
bad3 the distinction between the good and the bad priest is like that
between the dove and the raven sent out of the ark.

CAP. XXVIII. The young scholars who are being trained sor the
priesthood are in these days too often indolent and viciouS. If they
are so in youth, they will hardly be good in their later age.

CAP. XXIX. Tbey are induced to undertake the priesthood by
desire to escape from the control of the ordinary law, by dislike of
labour, and by love of good living, seldom by the higher motive, which
once prevailed, of contempt for worldly things and longing aster the

highest good. Thus, since the clergy is without the light of virtue, we .
laymen wanden· in the dark.
