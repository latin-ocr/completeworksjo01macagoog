xlvi GOWER’S LATIN WORKS

mnan QUARTUS.

CAP. 1. Men of Religious orders are also of various conditions, some
good and others bad. Let each bear his own burden of blame: 1 write
only what common report tells me.

γ There are first those who hold tempora! possessions‚ and some of
these live in gluttony and luxury.

CAP. 11. Those who leave the world should give up worldly things ς
but in these days the monk is known only by his μή). He indulges
himself with the richest food and the choioest drink, he makes haste
when the bell rings for a meal‚ but he rises very slowly and rel-uetantly
for midnight prayer. The monks of old were different3 they dwelt in
caves and had no luxurious halls or kitchens, they were clothed in skins,
sed on herbs and drank water, and abstained from fleshly lustr». These
men truly renounced the world, but that blessed state has now perished.

CAP. 111. The old monastic rule has given place to gluttony
and drunkenness, and those who live so can hardly be chaste. Pride,
anger and envy prevail among these men, in spite of the restrictione of

CAP. VIII. So also the regular Canons for the most part neglect
their monastic rule and have only a show of sanctity.

CAP. IX. Monks who are untrue to their profession are of all men
the most unhappy. They have no real enjoyment of this world and
they lose also the joys of heaven.

CAP. X. Let all members of religious orders perform their vows
and repent of their past sins, of their pride, luxury, avarice, ambition‚
gluttony, wrath, envy and strife.

CAP. XI. Above all let them avoid intercourse with women, who
bring death to their souIS. Let them labour and study; for idleness
is the great incentive to evil.

CAP. XII. The monk who sets himself to observe his rule will live
hardly and fast often, praying continually and doing penanee for sin.

ι He will submit himself humbly to his prior, and he will not grudge to
