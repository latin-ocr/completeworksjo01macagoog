xii INTRODUCTION

Under date Feb. 15 of the s'ame year it was reported that
this would not be to the prejudice os the king, and accordingly on
March 9 John Gower pays 5 3 shillings, which appears to be the
annual value of the property, and is pardoned · for the offence
committed by acquiring it without licence ¹.

39 Ed. III (June 2 3). Williarn Sepvanus, son of Williarn Sepvanus
knight, grants to John Gower ten pounds rent from the manor of
Wygebergh (Wigborough) in Essex and from other lands held by
himin the county of Essex⁸.

By another deed, acknowledged in Chancery on June 2 5 of
the same year, the same william Sepvanus makes over t'o John
Gower all his claims upon the manor of Ald'yngton‚ and also
a rent of 145. 6d., with one cock, thirteen hens and 140 eggs from
Maplecomb³.

42 Ed. 111 (1368). Thomas Syward, pewterer and citizen of
London, and Joanna his wife‘, daughter os Sir Robert Gower,
grant to John Gower and his heirs the manor of Kentwell. Dated
at Melford, Wednesday before the Nativity of St. John Baptist ⁴.

43 Ed. III. Fine between John Gower on the one hand, and
John Spenythorn with Joan his wife on the other, by which they
give up all right to the Manor of KentwelL SuffoIk, except A 10
rent, John Gower paying 200 marks ⁶.

This was confirmed in the king's court, 3 Ric. ΙΙ.

By documents of previous date ⁸ it may be shown that the
manor of Kentwell had been held by Sir Rob. Gower, doubtless
the same who is buried in Brabourne Church, who died apparently
in 1349 ς that it was ultimately divided, with other property,
between his heirs, two daughters named Katherine and Joanna‚
of whom one, Katherine‚ died in 1366. Her moiety was then
combined with the other in the possession of her sister Joanna,
‘ 23 years old and upwards,' then married to william Neve of
Wetyng‚ but apparently soon afterwards to Thomas Syward. , As

that ‘John Gower died seized of hals the manor of Aldyngton, 39 Ed. 111‚’ or
‘J ohn Gower died seized of the maner os Kentwell, 42 Ed. 111.’
