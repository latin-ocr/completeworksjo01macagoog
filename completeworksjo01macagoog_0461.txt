NOTES. Carnum-Lm. Ι. 40 371

431: Cp. ovid, Tuis-tia, i. 5. 53 f.

471. Cp. Pont. iv. 2. 19, where the comparison to a spring choked
with mud is more clearly brought out.

49. The original reading here was ‘ confracto,’ but it has been altered
to ‘ contracto ’ in C and G, while E gives ‘ contracto ⁹ from the first hand.
The general meaning seems to be that as the long pilgrimage to Rome
is to one with crippled knee‚ so is this work to the author, with his
limited powers of intellect.

56. The reading ‘conturbant’ in all the best MSS. seems to be
a mistake.

57 f. The author is about to denounce the evils of the world and
prodaim the woes which are to follow, like the writer of the Apocalypse‚
whose name he bears. Perhaps he may also have some thought of the
formula ‘seint John to· borwe’ by which travellers committed them-
selves to the protection of the saint on their setting forthz cp. Cons-
Amatam, v. 3416.

LIB. I.

1. The fourth year of Richard 11 is from June 22, 1380 to the same
date of 1381. The writer here speaks of the last mouth of that
,regnal year, during which the Peasants’ rising occurred.

4. Cp. Ovid, Her. xvii. 1 12, ⁶ Praevius Aurorae Lucifer ortus erat!

7 f. Godfrey of Viterbo, Pantheon, p. 24 (ed. 1584), has

‘ Luce diem reparat, mirandaque lumina praestat,
Sic fuga dat noctem, luxque reversa diem?

He is speaking of the Sun generally, and the second line means
⁶ Thus his departure produces the night and his returning light the
day.’ As introduced here this line is meaningless

9. Adapted from ovid, Metam. ii. 110.

11. Cp. Metam. vii. 703, but here ‘mane’ is made into the object of Ι

. the verb instead of an adverb.

'13. Cp. Metam. ii. 113.
15. Cp. Metam. ii. 24.
17 f. From Godsrey of viterbo, Pantheon, p. 24 (ed. 1584).
21 ff. Cp. Metam. ii. 107 fit,

‘ Aureus axis erat, temo aureuS, aurea summae
Curvatura rotae, radiorum argenteus ordo·
Per iuga chrysolithi positaeque ex ordine gemmae
Clara repercusso reddebant lumina Phoeb0.'

‘ alter ab auro ² seems to mean ‘ different from gold!

27. Cp. Metam. ii. 23.

33-60. This passage is largely from ovid: see especially Fasti,
