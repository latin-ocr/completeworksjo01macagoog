VOX CLAMANTIS
CAPITULA.

LIB. 1. Cap. iii. quandam vulgi turmam. It may be noted that these
headings do not always exactly coi-respond with those placed at the
head of the chapters afterwards. For example here the actual heading
of the chapter has ‘secundam vulgi turmam,’ and sor the succeeding
chapters ⁸ terciam ,³ ‘ quartam‚’ ‘quintam,’ &Q Usually the differences
are very trifling, as ‘illius terre’ for ‘terre illius ⁹ above, but sometimes they
proceed from the fact that alterations have been made in the chapter
headings, which the corrector has neglected to make in this Table of
Chapters. This is the case sor example as regards Lib. vl. Capp.xviii.
and xix. Slight variations of the kind first mentioned will be found in
Lib. 111. Capp. i, v, viii, xii, xvi, xix, xx.

‘ ΠΒ. 111. Cap. iiii. Theform which we have here in D corresponds to the

heading of the chapter given by LTH2 (but not by D itself) in the text
later. G has the text here aster ‘ loquitur’ written over an erasure.
’ L113. VII. Cap. xix. Here S has lost two leaves (the sixth and
seventh of the first full quire) to Lib. Ι. Cap. i. l. 18. The verso os the
former of these leaves had no doubt the four lines ‘Ad mundum mitto ' &Q
with picture, as in the Cotton MS.

LIB. Ι. PaoLocus.

3f. Cp. Confi Amantis, iv. 2921 ί,

‘Al be it so, that som men sein
That swevenes ben of no credence.'

‘propositum credulitatis ’ seems to mean ‘ true ground osheliett’

12. interim menttlr: cp. i. 1361.

15. That is, ‘hinc puto quod sompnia que vidi: ἃς.

21 ff. We are here told to add to ‘John ’ the first letters of ‘ Godfrey,’
the beginning of ‘WaleS,’ and the word ‘Ter’ without its head: that
is, ‘John Gower.’

23. que tali. The use of ‘ que ⁹ in this manner, standing
independently at the beginning of the clause, is very common in
Gower.

33 f. Taken from Ovid, Τ νίς-ἰὼ, v. 1. 5f.

36. Cp. Tristia, i. 1. 14, ‘ De lacrimis factas sentiet esse meis,’ which,
so sar as it goes, is in favour of the reading ⁸ senciat ⁹ here.

37 f. This couplet was originally Tm'stia, iv. 1. 95 f„

‘Saepe etiam lacrimae me sunt scribente profusae,
Humidaque est fietu litera facta meo!

The first line however was altered so as to lose its grammatical con-
struction, and the couplet was subsequently emended.
