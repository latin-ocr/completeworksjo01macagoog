October 1894, and was placed on the supposed site of the chapel
of St. John the Baptist‚ where it now stands ¹.

In the course of nearly five centuries the tomb has undergone
many changes, and the present colouring and inscription are not
original. What we have now is a mnopy os three arches over an
altar tomb‚ on which lies an effigy of the poet, habited in a long
dark-coloured gown, with a standing cape and buttoned down to
his feet, wearing a gold collar of SS, fastened in front with
a device of a chained swan between two portcullises. His head
rests on a pile of three folio volumes marked with the names of
his three principal works, Vox Clamanttlr, Speculum Medt‘tantzk,
Confessio Amantis. He has a rather round face with high cheek-
boneS, a moustache and a slightly forked heard, hair long and
curling upwards ², and round his head a chaplet of four red roses
at intervals upon a band ³, with the words ⁶ merci ihs ⁴' (repeated)
in the intervals between the rosest the hands are put together
and raised in prayer: at the feet there is a lion or mastiff lying.
The upper ledge of the tomb has this inscription, ⁶ Hic iacet
Ι. Gower Arm. Angl. poeta celeberrimus ac huic sacro edificio
benefac. insignis. Vixit temporibus Edw. 111 et Ric. 11 et Henr. lv)
In front os the tomb there are seven arched niches. Against the
wall at the end of the recess, above the feet of the figure, a shield

¹ 1 am indebted for some of the facts to Canon Thompson of St. Saviour's‚
Southwark, who has been kind enough to answer several questions which
1 addressed to him.

² The features are quite different, it seems to me, froin those represented
in the Cotton and Glasgow MSS„ and 1 think it more likely that the latter
give us ι true contemporary portrait. Gower certainly died in advaneed
age, yet the effigy on his tomb shows us a man in the ssower of life. This
then is either an ideal representat10n or must have been executed froin
rather distant memory‚ wheneas the miniatures in the MSS„ which closely
resemble each other, were probably from lise, and also preserve their original
colouring. The miniatures in MSS. of the Confesstb A mutis, which represent
the Confession, show the penitent usually as ι conventional young lover.
The picture in the Fairfax MS. is too much damaged to give us much
guidunce, but it does not seem to be a porti-ait, in spite os the collar os SS
added later. The miniature in MS. Bodley 902, however, represents ιιι
aged man, while that of the Cambridge MS. Um. ο. 21 rather remus the effigy
on the tomb and may have been suggested by it.

³ We may note that the effigy os Sir Robert Gower in brass above his tomb
in Brabourne church is represented as having a similar chaplet round his
helmet. See the drawing in MS. Harl. 3917, f. 77.

⁴ So 1 read them. They are given by Gough and others as ‘ merci ihi!
