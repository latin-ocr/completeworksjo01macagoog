lxviii · GOWER'S LATIN WORKS

picture of an archer aiming at the globe on f. 21, and the chapters
have red initial letters. original oak binding. Ι

The names ‘ Thomas Eymis ² and ⁶ William Turner' occur as those of
sixteenth-century owners. The note on the inside of the binding,
⁶ Henry Beauchamp lyeing in St. John strete at the iii. Cuppcs,’ can
hardly be taken to indicate ownership.

The most noticeable fact about the text of this MS. is one to which no
attention has hitherto been called, viz. the omission of the whole history
of the Peasants' Revolt. After Lib. i. cap. i. the whole of the remainder of
the first book (nearly 9,οο0 lines) is omitted without any note of deficiency,
and we pass on to the Prologue of Lib. ii, not so named here, but standing as
the second chapter of Lib. i. (the chapters not being numbered however in this
MS). Aster what we commonly call the second book follows tbe heading of
the Prologue of Lib. iii, but without any indication that a new book is begun.
Lib. iv. is marked by the rubricator as ‘liber iiim: Lib. v. as ‘liber iiii¹¹¹‚' and
so on to the end, making six books instead of seven3 but there are traces
of another numbering, apparently by the scribe who wrote the text, accord·
ing to which Lib. v. was rechoned as ⁴ liber liin: Lib. iv. as ‘liber iiii* ⁹ and
Lib. vii. as ‘liber vu! It has been already observed that there is interna]
evidence to show that this arrangement in five (or six) books may have been the
original form of the text of the Vox clamantia At the same time it must be
noted that this form is given by no other Msaexcept the Lincoln book, which
is certainly copied from L, and that the nature of the connexion between L
and D seems to indicate that these two MSS. are ultimately derived from the
same source. This connexion, established by a complete collation of the
two MSS.. extends apparently throughout the whole of the text of L. ‘We
have, for example, in both, i. Prol. 97, laudes, 58 Huius ergo, ii. 94 et ibi, 319
causat, 614 Ingenuitque, iii. 4 mundus, 996 ei, 407 amor'Qbr maior), 536 Hec,
750 timidus, 758 curremus, 889 iuris, 1096 Nil, 1993 mundus, 1998 bona, 1491
egras, 1584 racio, 1655 Inde vola, 1777 lbi, 1868 timet, 1906 seruet, 9075,9080
qui, iv. 59 vrbe, 99 tegit, and so on. The common source was not an immedi-
ate one, for words omitted by D with a blank or ‘deficit ⁹ as iii. 641, vii. 487
are found in L, and the words ‘ nescit,’ ‘ deus,’ which are omitted with a
blank left in L at iii. 1574 and vi. 349 are found in D. If we suppose a common
source, we must assume either that the first book was found in it entire and
deliberately omitted, with alteration of the numbering of the books, by the
copyist of the MS. from which L is more immediately derived, or that it was

not found, and that the copyist of the original of D supplied it from another
source.

1t should be noted that the MS. from which L is ultimately derived must
have had alternative versione of some of the revised passages, for in vi. cap.
xviii. and also vi. 1. 1908 L give· both the revised and the unrevised form.
As a rule in the matter of revision L agrees with D, but notin the corrections
of vi. 1908-1996, where D has the uncorrected form and L the other. We
may note especially the reading of L in vi. 1994. ’
