lviii GOWER'S LAT1 N WORKS

Some reference ought perhaps to be 'made in conclusion to the
list of Gower's works given by Bale and copied by others, with
a view to the question whether he was acquainted with any works
of Gower. which are not known to us· In his Scriptorum Illu-
sm'um Catalogus, p. 524 (ed. 1559) he says that Gower wrote

‘ Speculum Medzl'antis, Gallice, Lib. 10.

‘ Confessionem Amantia Anglice, Lib. 8, ‘⁸ Eorum qui ante nos
scripserunt.”

‘ Vocem Clamantzze, Latine, Lib. 7, “ Scriptum veteris capiunt
exempla.”

‘ De compunctione carchae, Lib. 1.

‘ Chronicon Ricardi Secundi, Lib. 3, “Opus humanum est inquirere.”

‘ chronicon impertitum, Lib. 3, ‘⁴ Tolle caput mundi C. ter et sex?

‘Ad Henn'cum quartum, Lib. 1, ‘⁴ Nobilis ac digne rex Henrioe.”

‘ De eodem rege Henn‘co, Lib. 1, “ Rex celi deus et dominus?

‘ De peste. vitiorum, Lib. 1, “ Non excusatur qui verum non fateatur.'’

‘ Scrutim‘um lucit, Lib. 1, “ Heu quia per crebras humus est?

‘ De coniugii dtjgm'tate, Lib. 1, “ Qualiter creator omnium rerum
Deu3.”

‘ De regimine principum, “ Ο deus immense, sub quo dominatur.”

‘ Epigrammata quaedam, Lib. 1, “ Alta petens aquila volat alitque.”

‘ De amoris varietate, Lib. 1, “ Est amor in glosa pax bellica.”

‘ Carmina diuersa, Lib. 1, et alia plura.’

In regard to this list it may be observed first that in the two
cases where the beginning of the book or piece in question is not
cited, we may safely assume that Bale had not seen it. This
applies to the Speculum Meditantis and the supposed piece De
compunctione cordtk, of which 1 can give no account. It will be
observed that he makes the short prose preface to the Crom‘ca
Tnpertita, ‘ Opus humanum est inquirere ’ &c., into a separate
work in three books. The other items are all recognizable, ex-
cept ‘ Epigrammata quaedam, Lib. 1, “Alta petens aquila volat
alitque.'’ ' Here we may observe that the quotation is from Vox
Clamantis vi. 985, ‘ Alta petens aquila volat alite celsius omni,'
διο. (a passage taken from the Aurora); and on referring to Bale’s
unpublished papers ¹ we find the description of this supposed
book of epigrams in the following form, ‘ Ex suo libro et sancti-
fidensi chron. Epigrammata edidit, li. 1, “ Alta petens aquila volat
alite‚” ' whence we should gather that the book referred to was
a collection of quotationS. It is probable that Bale may have

¹ communicated to me by Miss Bat'eson.
