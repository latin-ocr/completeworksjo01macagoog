LIFE OF GOWER xvii

⁸ because my lord had given his collar to another esquire beyond
sea ’ ¹. This particular collar given to John Gower was a corn·
paratively chaep one, worth apparently only 265. 8d., while the
silver collar to be given to John Payne is valued at 565. sd„ and
agold collar osSS for Henry himself costs no less than Α 26 8s. 1 td.
The fact that Gower wears a collar of SS on his tomb makes
it probable enough that he is the esquire mentioned in this
document. It will afterwards be seen that we cannot base any
argument upon the fact that the collar upon the effigy is now gilt,
and apparently was so also in Leland’s time.

2 5 Jan. 1397-8. A licence from the bishop of Winchester
for solemnizing the marriage between John Gower and Agnes
Groundolf, both parishioners of St. Mary Magdalene, Southwark‚
without further publication of banns and in a place outside their
parish church, that is to say, in the oratory of the said John
Gower, within his lodging in the Priory of Saint Mary Overey in
Southwark. Dated at Highclere‚ 2 5 Jan. 1397 ⁸. At this time
then Gower was living in the Priory of St. Mary Overey, and
no doubt he continued to do so until his death.

Finally, Aug. 15, 1408, the Will of John Gower, which was
proved Oct. 24 of the same year ⁸. His death therefore may be
presumed to have taken place in October, 1408.

This will has been printed more than once, in Gough‘s
Sepulchra! Monuments, by Todd in his Illustrations os Gower and
chancer and in the Retrospectt‘ve Rem'ew.

The testator bequeathes his soul to the Creator, and his body to be
buried in the church of the Canons of St. Mary omres, in the place
specially appointed sor this purpose (‘ in loco ad hoc specialiter
deputato ⁹). To the Prior of the said church he bequoethes 40³2, to
the subprior zos„ to each Canon who is a priest 13s. 4d.‚ and to each
os the other Canons 6s. 8d.‚ that they may all severally pray for him the
more devoutly at his funeral. To the servants of the Priory 2s. or ts.
each according to their position ς to the church of St. Mary Magdalene

² Καρ-ἐςτιν os Wdlr‘am of Wykelmm, ii. f. 299b. The record was kindly
verified for me by the Registrar of the diocese of winchester. The expression
used about the place is ‘in Oratorio ipsius Iohannis Gower infra hospicium
suum ’ (not ‘cum ' as previously printed) ‘in Prior-atu Beate Marie de Overee
in Southwerke predicta situatum· lt should be noted that ‘infra ⁸ ln these
documents means not ⁴ below,' as translated by Prof. Morley, but ⁸ within?

So also in Gower’s will.
