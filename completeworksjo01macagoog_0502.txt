Adam of Usk about the king’s prooeedings in this parliament at
Shrewsbury (p. 17).

49 ff. These transactions are related, but not very intelligibly, in the
continuation of the Eulogium Histo'nmm, iii. 378. It seems that the
king summoned the archbishop and bishops to his Council at N otting-
ham, and used their influence to obtain from the city of London and the
seventeen enunties adjacent acknowledgements of guilt and payments
of money to procure pardon. After this the king ordered that the arch-
bishopS, bishops, abbots‚ δια, and also the individua! citizens of towns,
should set their seals to blank parchments, wherein afterwards a pro-
mise to keep the statutes of the last parliament was inscribed, to which
it was supposed that the king intended to add acknowledgements placing
the persons in question and their property at his own disposal: cp.
Monk of Evesham‚ p. 147. These last are the ‘blanche-chartres'
spoken of below called ‘ blanke chartours’ in Gregory’s Chronicle,
p. 101, where the form of submission sent in by the city of London,
‘in plesauns of the kynge and by conselle and helpe of Syr Roger
Walden, Archebischoppe of Cauntyrbury ande Syr Robert Braybroke,
Byschoppe of London‚’ is given in full, pp. 98-100. See also Rot.

’ cause, namely the king's jealousy of his popularity and sear that he
might take the lead in opposition to the newly established arbitrary
system of government. The very occasion of the quan-el with the
duke of N orfolk‚ an allegation on the part of Henry that the duke of
Norfolk had warned him of danger from Richard and had said that
the king could not be trusted to keep his oathS, made it difficult to take
more summary measures against him at that moment. Indeed it
seems probable that the conversation was reported to the king with a
view to obtain a contradiction of the design imputed to him. Adam
os Usk says definitely that the king’s object in appointing the duel at
Coventry was to get rid of Henry, and that Richard had been assured
by astrologers that the duke os Norfolk would win3 but that on seeing
them in the lists he was convinced that Henry would be the victor,
and therefore he broke off the duel and banished both, intending
