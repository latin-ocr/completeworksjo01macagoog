the first Adam brought evil upon us all, so the strength of the second
Adam healed our wound and restored our fallen state.

CAP. IX. We must submit our mind to the saith, for man cannot
understand the things of God, and we must not examine too closely
the mystery which we cannot penetrate. This we know, that lise
is given to all through the name of Jesus Christ.

CAP. X. The heathen bows down to figures of wood and stone,
asking help from that which his hands have made. Was not the
world made for man and all things placed in subjection to him? How
then can these idols be of any avail?

As for us, we use images differently, not giving to them the worship
that belongs to God, but by them assisting devotion; especially the
sign of the Cross is to be adored, by means of which we conquer the
powers of evil. Great is the virtue of the Cross, by which Christ
despoiled hell of its prey and ascended into heaven.

CAP. 201. God created the heaven and the earth, and all created
things ought to serve him. As he creates all things, so also he rules
them continually, and he gives his gifts according to men’s merit.

whatever comes to pass in the world, whether it be good or evil, we
are the cause of it.

0 Christ, grant that Ι may avoid falsehood and flattery. With this
prayer Ι enter on my voyage.

CAP. 1. The order of the world is in three degreeS,—-Clergy, Knight-
hood and Peasantry. 1 shall deal first with the prelates of the
Church, whose practice is very far removed from the example of
Christ. Riches alone are valued by them, and the poor man is
despised, whatever may be his merits.

CAP. 11. Prelates of the Church are now hirelings‚ whose desire is
to live in luxury and to indulge their appetites. Gluttony and lust
everywhere prevail.

CAP. 111. The prelates of the Church aim at earthly honours
instead of heavenly: they desire rather to have the pre-eminence than
