(Walsingham, i. 285), and the somewhat prejudioed account of their
faults in Walsingham, ii. 13. The influenoe of the Dominican Rushook¹

Ric ar .

735 ff. Cp. Asirour de POmme, 21469 ff.

736. sepulta: used elsewhere by Gower for ‘funeral rites,’ e. g.
i. 1179. The meaning is that the friar claims to perform the funeral
services sor the dead bodies of those whose confessor he has been
before death. Perhaps however we should take ‘ sepulta ’ here as
equivalent to ‘ sepelienda.’

777 f. Cp. Ovid, Tristia, i. 9. 7f.

781. Tristia, i. 9. 9.

784. Cp. Fasti, v. 354.

788. See Mirour, 2162 5 ff. and note.

795. ‘ Prioris ' in S, but it is evidently an adjective here.

813 ff. Cp. Μίνων, 214991ὶῖ

84⁷. The wording is suggested· by 1 Cor. ix. 24, ‘ii qui in stadio
currunt, omnes quidem currunt, sed unus accipit bravium!

864. Titiuillus: see note in Dyce’s edition of Skelton, vol. ii. pp. 2841:

869. Cp. Job ii. 4, ‘Pellem pro pelle, et cuncta quae habet homo,
dabit pro anima sua!

872. vltima verba hgant. As in a bargain the last words are those
that are binding, so here the last word mentioned, namely ‘demon,’ is
,the true answer to the question.

874. ‘ Men sein, Old Senne newe schame, ' Cous. Amantis, iii. 2033.

903. Cp. Ovid, Metam. ii. 632, ‘Inter aves albas vetuit consistere
corvum.' Gower’s line seems to have neither accidence nor syntax.

953f. Fasti, ii. 219f.

959. Α reference to Ps. lxxii. 5, ‘ In labore hominum non sunt, et
cum hominibus non flagellabuntur? The same passage is alluded to
in Walsingham?s chronicle (i. 324), where reference is made to the
fact that the friars were exempted from the poll—tax. The first hals of
this psalm seems to have been accepted in some quarters as a prophetie
description of the Mendicants.

963. There is no variation of reading here in the MSS„ but the
mette cannot be regarded as satisfactory. A fifteenth (or sixteenth)
century reader has raised a slight protest against it in the margin of
S,‘ at metrum quomodo fiet.’

969. Cp. Ps. lxxii. 7, ‘Prodiit quasi ex adipe iniquitas eorum:
transierunt in affectum cordis?

‘Mal fils ne tret son pris avant,
