1059-1064. These six lines are taken without change from Aurora,
(MS. Bodley 822) f. 65.

1072. ‘ lingua’ was here the original reading, but was altered to
‘ verba ' in most of the copies. H and G have ‘ verba ’ overan erasure.
· 1081. In G we have ‘ adepcio ’ by correction from ‘ adopcio.’

ι (19190. adheret: meant apparently for pres. subj. as if from a verb
a erare!

1099 f. Cp. Aurora, f. 19‘v⁰‚

‘Sarra parit, discedit Agar3 pariente fideles
Ecclesia populos, dat synagoga locum.’

1103. Odium. · written thus with a capital letter in H, but not in she
οΰίἰῧλξὲρ. Mer-our cle l'Omme, 214o3ff. and note.
1145 ff. These lines are partly from N eckam s Vua Monachorum,
p 192 ‘Porticibus vallas operosis atria, quales
Quotque putas thalamos haec labyrinthus habet.

Ostia multa quidem, variae sunt mille fenestrae,
Mille columnarum est marmore fulta domus!

Gower alters the first sentence by substituting ‘ valnas ⁹ for the verb
‘ vallas! ‘ It has folding-doors‚ halls, and bed-chambers as various and
as many as the labyrinth.'

1161. ⁸ historia parisiensis ’ in the MSS. Ι cannot supply a reference.

1175 f. From De Vita Monachomm, p. 193.

1189 ff. The reference is to the Speculum Stultorum, where Burnel
- the AsS‚ after examining the rules of all the existing orders and finding
them in various ways unsatisfactory to him, comes to the conclusion
‘ that he must found an order of his own, the rules of which shall combine
the advantages of all the other orders. Members os it shall be allowed
to ride easily like the TemplarS, to tell lies like the Hospitallers, to eat
meat on Saturday like the Benedictines of Cluny, to talk sreely like
the brothers of Grandmont, to go to one mass a mouth, or at most two,
like the carthusians, to dress comfortably like the Praemonstratensians‚
and so on. What‘ is said here by our author expresses the spirit of
these rules rather than the letter.

1197 s. The text here gives the original reading, found m THn and
remaining unaltered m S. CHG have ‘ et si ' written over an erasure,
and in the next line ‘ Mechari cupias ’ is written over erasure in G,
‘ Mechari cupias ordine’ in C, and ‘ ordine’ alone in H. The other
MSS. have no erasures· ·

1212. C HG have this line written over an erasure.

1214. Written over erasure in CHG, the word ‘magis’ being still
visible in G as the last word of the line in the earlier text. The expres-
sion ‘ Linquo coax ranis ’ is said to have been used by Serlo on his
renunciation of the schools: see Leyser, Hm. Poet. p. 443.
